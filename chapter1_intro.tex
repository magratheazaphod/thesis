\section{Constraints on monthly rainfall rates}
Above all else, this is a study about rainfall, and in particular its heterogeneity, both spatial and temporal. As mentioned in \cite{Trenberth}, the size and intensity of storms is fundamentally constrained by the supply of 

\section{Heterogeneity}
Distributions of rainfall vary on shorter distances than other atmospheric variables.

\subsection{Space}
The distribution of rainfall with space depends strongly on both time-variant and invariant properties of the atmosphere and land surface: Land-sea contrast, the distribution of orography and sea surface temperature (SST).
