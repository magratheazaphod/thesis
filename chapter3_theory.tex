\chapter{Moisture Transport as a Coupling Mechanism}

In Chapters 2 and 3, we established a link between rainfall variability in India and China. Furthermore, we found that the spatial pattern of this mode of variability does not correspond to a shift or intensification of existing storm tracks. In this section we propose a new hypothesis: That the leading mode of Indian rainfall variability induces changes in moisture transport that percolate to central China.

\section{Climatology of a High-Resolution Model - Preliminary Support}

\section{Constraining Observations/Preliminary Support}

What observations could we obtain that could help to further test this hypothesis?
