\section{Abstract}
We have previously investigated the leading mode of July-August Asian monsoon variability (All-Asia EOF1) and argued that this mode manifests a coupling between the Himalayan Foothills and Yangtze River Valley. In this chapter, we investigate the manifestation of All-Asia EOF1 in JRA-55 reanalysis and further associated atmospheric anomalies across the Northern Hemisphere. Extreme years of All-Asia EOF1 correspond to a global-scale Northern Hemisphere wavetrain known as the Circumglobal Teleconnection (CGT), leading to robust temperature and rainfall anomalies. Geopotential height anomalies at all atmospheric levels are barotropic except for a coherent band of diabatic heating across the Himalayan foothills and Yangtze Corridor with cooling to the west, akin to the ``monsoon-desert'' mechanism. JRA-55 reanalysis supports the hypothesis in Chapter 2 that changes in moisture transport across the Yunnan Plateau cause observed rainfall anomalies. Furthermore, we propose that the pattern of diabatic heating is a direct result of these moisture transport changes, which create a robust trough and ridge pattern over East Asian high-latitudes, and therefore may contribute to the known phenomenon of phase-locking of the CGT in summer. 

Over East Asia, positive All-Asia EOF1 years feature a robust southward shift in the tropospheric jet, and vice-versa in negative years. Major late-twentieth-century changes in the latitude of frontal rainfall (the ``South Flood-North Drought'') also coincide with anomalies in East Asian jet latitude. The position of the East Asian jet responds to variability in heating over China, but we argue that the jet also translated global climate change into regional impact over East Asia. Though the mid-latitudes force East Asian monsoon weather chaotically (the ``Silk Road'' pattern), the effect of twenty-first-century global warming on the East Asian jet and on moisture transport across the Yunnan Plateau can be studied and projected with greater confidence. Anticipating changes in these two elements of Asian summer climate may improve projections of twenty-first-century rainfall change in China and East Asia, which remain highly uncertain as of the latest International Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC5).

\section{Introduction}

	In many of the world's most populous regions, the duration and severity of monsoon rainfall dictates the well-being of the populace by controlling crop yields, flooding and freshwater supply. The history of monsoon study is therefore replete with attempts at its prediction dating back over a century, such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD)'s official seasonal forecast (available at \url{http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/monsoon_main.php}) and recent concerted efforts such as the `Seasonal Prediction of the Indian Monsoon' (SPIM) project \citep{Gadgil2011}. Nonetheless, IMD operational forecasts of the Indian monsoon demonstrated no skill over the years 1989-2012\cite{Wang2015}. Past generations of global climate models have struggled even to produce a realistic mean state for the Indian monsoon \citep{Gadgil2003}, let alone its variability \citep{KrishnaKumar2005}. 
	
	An even bigger challenge awaits in the prediction of the future of the monsoon under global warming. Twenty-first-century changes in mean temperature and rainfall will impact the livelihood of billions \citep{Barrios2010,Burke2015}. Unfortunately, in the latest iteration of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC5), it is acknowledged that models struggle to produce realistic patterns of rainfall in the Asian monsoon region due to the heterogeneity of high terrain \citep{Christensen2011}. Weak consensus exists between models on twenty-first-century rainfall increase in China under their RCP4.5 scenario, and only ``medium confidence'' in increasing rainfall during the South Asian summer monsoon. At a more fundamental level, even simplified (aquaplanet) versions of the CMIP5 models respond entirely differently under elementary climate perturbations such as a uniform 4K temperature increase, due primarily to their inability to parametrize moist convection and cloud formation in a physically realistic way \citep{Stevens2013}. Therefore, even in regions where the models do arrive at a consensus, it is not clear that their projections should be trusted. Meanwhile, from a theoretical standpoint, it is debated whether the future Asian monsoon could undergo nonlinear change under global warming \citep{Zickfeld2005}, or will instead evolve linearly \citep{Boos2016}.
	
	In this chapter, we focus on the leading mode of Asian monsoon rainfall variability, named All-Asia EOF1 in \citet{Day2015}, and its relation to other regional and global modes of climate variability. All-Asia EOF1 features enhanced precipitation over the Himalayan Foothills and Yangtze River corridor in its positive phase and decreased precipitation over the Monsoon Zone, northern China and southernmost China, and vice-versa in its negative phase. We first find using composite analysis that All-Asia EOF1 is correlated with a wavelike pattern of anomalies across the Northern Hemisphere known as the Circumglobal Teleconnection (CGT). In the second, we find that the South Flood-North Drought pattern of twentieth-century rainfall change in China was also accompanied by changes in the East Asian jet. Thus, All-Asia EOF1 rainfall variability implies a corresponding set of atmospheric changes at the scale of the entire Northern Hemisphere.
	
	The CGT and the East Asian tropospheric jet respond to global modes of climate variability and will be influenced by \nth{21}-century global warming. The CGT is defined as the second EOF of summer midlatitude geopotential height variability (EOF1 reflects ENSO). In the past several decades, severe heat waves and droughts have been ascribed to high-wavenumber standing Rossby wave circulations \citep{Schubert2011}. In several cases, Eurasian heat waves were directly tied to South Asian monsoon extremes \citep{Lau2012,Trenberth2012}. Current debate investigates whether polar amplification observed in \nth{20}-century warming will make midlatitude blocking events more frequent and severe \citep{Francis2012}, or not \citep{Barnes2013,Hassanzadeh2014a}. The response of the the tropospheric jet to climate change has also been extensively studied. The jets marks the poleward boundary of the Hadley Cells \citep{Bordoni2008}, and therefore shift in response to global changes in inter-hemispheric heating gradient\citep{Chiang2012}. Therefore, it can be argued that the jet translates global climate forcings into regional climate change. Observations show a poleward shift in previous decades in response to global warming \citep{Fu2006,Archer2008,Fu2011}, but the opposite trend is found over East Asia \citep{Yu2007, Archer2008,Park2014a}. The poleward expansion of the Hadley Cell is projected to continue under \nth{21}-century warming \citep{Frierson2007,Lu2007,Kang2012}, but a recent study predicts that anomalous \nth{21}-century heating of the eastern Pacific Ocean will continue to push the East Asian jet further equatorward \citep{Park2014}.
	
	In summary, much work has already been done to anticipate changes in the CGT and the tropospheric jet on a warmer planet. By showing in this chapter that both of these climate components and the All-Asia EOF1 mutually influence one another, we open the possibility of using our understanding of future midlatitude blocking event and jet changes to improve projections of the \nth{21}-century Asian monsoon.

\section{Data and Methods}

\subsection{JRA-55 Reanalysis}

	We rely on the JRA-55 reanalysis product assembled by the Japanese Meterological Association (JMA) \citep{Kobayashi2015,Harada2016}. JRA-55 is a state-of-the-art 56-year (1958-2013) reanalysis product, the first since ERA-40 to cover the past half-century. The realism of model climate is notably improved from the previous generation product, JRA-25, due in part to a brand new assimilation scheme. Fields are calculated model resolution of up to 640x320 (.625$^{\circ} \times .625^{\circ}$), with exact number of longitude points varying by latitude. The products used in this analysis are upscaled to 1.25$^{\circ} \times 1.25^{\circ}$. Monthly fields at the 700-mb, 500-mb and 200-mb levels were used, as well as column-integrated values where applicable. We calculated monthly anomalies in JRA-55 fields for positive and negative composites of years (described below), and also calculated normalized anomalies by finding the monthly standard deviation of each field for each calendar month. For a field $X$ and calendar month $m$, we calculate the monthly standard deviation $\sigma_{X_m}$:
	
\begin{equation*}
	\sigma_{X_m}(x,y)=\left(\sum_{56\ years} \left(X_m(x,y,yr)-\overline{X_m(x,y)}\right)^2 \right)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}
	
\subsection{Historical Precipitation and Temperature Records}

	We rely on the University of Delaware precipitation data set (hereafter referred to as UDEL) v4.01, available at $.5^{\circ} \times .5^{\circ}$ resolution (land only) for the years 1900-2014 \citep{Matsuura2015}. Data are assimilated from station records before being interpolated onto the grid, with quality control algorithms applied to weed out faulty records. For the testing of statistical significance, we use the same years as available in JRA-55, 1958-2013, which also feature higher station coverage than the first half of the \nth{20} century.

	Monthly temperature anomalies from 1958 to 2013 gridded at $1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$ resolution were obtained from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project (hereafter referred to as BEST), freely available at \url{http://www.berkeleyearth.org/data/} \citep{Rohde2012}. BEST agrees closely with past historical temperature estimates, but the gridless methodology used can incorporate a wider range of temperature records \citep{Rohde2013}. According to their best estimate, global land mean temperature increased by $.89 \pm .06^{\circ}$C from 1950-1959 to 1990-1999. Therefore, in order to compare local temperature anomalies on an even footing, the temperature time series are detrended based on 1958-2013 local slope. At each point, we separate the time series into 12 separate monthly time series (each consisting of 56 Januarys, Februarys and so on) and then detrend each monthly time series based on the 56-point trend in that month.
	
\subsection{Composite Analysis}		
	
	We construct positive and negative composite anomalies for July and August from JRA-55 data, UDEL precipitation and BEST temperature. Positive composite years were chosen by selecting the five years between 1958 and 2007 when the value of All-Asia EOF1 was highest \citep{Day2015}. We then create a positive composite anomaly by averaging over fields in those five years and subtracting from the 56-year mean (1958-2013). The same procedure was repeated for the 5 most negative July All-Asia EOF1 years in the same timespan, and then the entire process repeated for the month of August. Further detail on selected years is included in Tables \ref{tab:t41}. Most figures in this paper show the \textit{difference} between the positive and negative composites, or ``inter-composite difference,'' except where otherwise stated.
	
	%again, can mention compositing with All-Nepal Monsoon Rainfall, but non-essential to chapter.
	
\subsection{Montecarlo Estimates of Statistical Significance}	
	
	Two methods are used to calculate the statistical significance of inter-composite differences: An analytic calculation based on the monthly standard deviation, and a Montecarlo method that generates arbitrary composites with 10,000 iterations. 

\subsubsection{Analytic Calculation}	
	
	The analytic method approximates the distribution of anomalies as Gaussian. For a field of interest $X$ in month $m$, we construct positive composite $X_{m+}$, negative composite $X_{m-}$ and normalized inter-composite difference $Z_{X_m}$ with total number of observation months $N$ and monthly standard deviation $\sigma_{X_m}$:
	
\begin{align*}
	X_{m+} &= \left(X_{m+,1}+X_{m+,2}+X_{m+,3}+X_{m+,4}+X_{m+,5}\right)/5 \\
	X_{m-} &= \left(X_{m-,1}+X_{m-,2}+X_{m-,3}+X_{m-,4}+X_{m-,5}\right)/5 \\
	Z_{X_m} &= \frac{N^{1/2}\left(X_{m+} - X_{m-}\right)}{\sigma_{X_m}}
\end{align*}

	$Z_{X_m}$ can then be converted to a $p$-value assuming that anomalies are normally distributed.

\subsubsection{Montecarlo Method}	
	
	For each iteration of the Montecarlo method, we create random non-overlapping positive and negative composites of five random years each from any of the 56 Julys (and analogously for August) and then find the inter-composite difference at each spatial point. At the end of 10,000 iterations, we find an effective $p$-value at each point by comparing the actual composite difference to the 10,000 simulated differences. The Montecarlo method is generally found to be a much stricter test of significance. Figures showing statistical significance use Montecarlo-estimated $p$-values. We also calculate an additional p-value for the entire pattern, namely the probability that the total \textit{area} exceeding a 95\% confidence level could be obtained at random. Since we are particularly interested in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, we sum the total significant area between 20$^{\circ}$N and 65$^{\circ}$N and divide by total area. This ``pattern'' $p$-value is listed on the top-right of figures when calculated, and the region of interest delimited. Since the test statistic in this case is one-sided, a pattern $p$-value exceeding .95 would be significant at a 95\% confidence level.

\subsection{Jet Count Density} 

	\citet{Schiemann2009} constructed a data set of jet ``counts'' in the Tibetan Plateau region (46$^{\circ}$ E-130$^{\circ}$ E, 17$^{\circ}$ N-58$^{\circ}$ N) from ERA-40 reanalysis for 1958-2001, where a count is defined as any local maximum in zonal wind with westerly magnitude greater than $30$ m s$^{-1}$; further details can be found in section 2 of \citet{Schiemann2009}. We show daily mean jet latitude averaged across $90-130^\circ$E in Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}a and monthly anomalies in Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b and c. Results are not sensitive to the choice of longitude range. Figure ~\ref{fig:climo} presents contours of jet frequency estimated by a kernel density method, which estimates a probability distribution from a set of discrete data observations. The \citet{Schiemann2009} database is also tested for covariance with the Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA) catalog from Chapter 3 ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}, with results described subsequently.
	
\section{Composites of All-Asia EOF1 in JRA-55}

\subsection{Circumglobal Teleconnection}

	We build composites of the most positive and negative years of All-Asia EOF1 and find robust global change in upper-tropospheric height (Z200) across the Northern Hemisphere. The largest signal is a massive rise in geopotential height in the Tropics in the July composite, a known phenomenon in strong ENSO years ~\ref{fig:cgt_zonal}, even though All-Asia EOF1 is not significantly correlated with ENSO. The absolute magnitude of anomalies in the Tropics remains less than in mid-latitudes because its variability is much lower (sidebar of Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_zonal}a). To focus on wavelike mid-latitude behavior, we subtract the zonal mean anomaly in subsequent figures where useful, as shown for instance in Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_zonal}c and ~\ref{fig:cgt_zonal}d.
	
	In July (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}a), strong All-Asia EOF1 years are associated with a zonal wavenumber 5 standing wave spanning the entire Northern Hemisphere. Analyzing 200-mb geopotential height (Z200),  pronounced positive lobes are visible over Russia, the eastern Pacific, western North America and the Azores, and negative lobes over Pakistan, northeast Asia and northern Europe. In August (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}b), a similar pattern is obtained with some shifts: the northeast Asian lobe bifurcates into a Korean and Aleutian pair, the Siberian high strengthens and the North American high merges with that in the Eastern Pacific. Both the July and August Z200 anomaly patterns are significant at a 95\% confidence level. Considering the mid-troposphere and near-surface, we find that geopotential height anomalies are mostly barotropic and remain visible at the 700-mb level, except for over Pakistan where the 200-mb low is replaced by a surface high, and a belt from the eastern Tibetan Plateau eastward with 200-mb highs and 700-mb lows (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_qq} a-b). These reflect cooling over Pakistan and heating over northern India, the Yangtze River Valley and western Pacific. All patterns are significant at a 95\% level except for Z700 in August.
	
	These patterns strongly resembles the Circumglobal Teleconnection (hereafter CGT) studied in \citet{Ding2005a}. \citet{Branstator2002} originally found that, in regions of strong meridional temperature gradient such as East Asia, a pattern with zonal wavenumber 5 can extend around the globe, with the tropospheric jet serving as a waveguide favoring the zonal propagation of storms. They were able both to find evidence of such a mode in reanalysis and demonstrate its existence in a simplified model. Figure 1c of \citet{Branstator2002} closely resembles our Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_zonal}d. Looking more closely at Figures 5b and c of \citet{Ding2005a} we find that they are practically identical to our Figures ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}a and ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}b (with sign inverted), including the set of changes between July and August. Furthermore, geopotential height anomalies of the studied global wavetrains in both \citet{Branstator2002} and \citet{Ding2005a} are consistently barotropic except over India ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}. We conclude that the mid-latitude wavetrain associated with All-Asia EOF1 and the CGT as defined by \citet{Ding2005a} are the same pattern.
	
	Another way of displaying the same wavetrain pattern is to consider the upper-level meridional wind (V200). Since the zonal mean of meridional wind is 0 and also near-zero in composites, waves are apparent without additional filtering \citep{Branstator2002}. Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_v} shows V200 for the July and August composites. The number of lobes can easily be counted, and the July wavetrain appears to be of wavenumber 6 while August is of wavenumber 5. From the Aleutian Islands to the eastern United States, the pattern of meridional wind anomalies in fact reverses from July to August, while remaining largely similar over Eurasia, showing substantial change between July and August. The existence of substantial differences between the July and August wavetrain patterns was also found in \citet{Ding2005a}. Although \citet{Day2015} argues that July and August All-Asia EOF1 are highly similar over the Asian monsoon region, this is evidently not true at the global scale.
	
	Finally, we consider the global distribution of temperature and precipitation anomalies associated with All-Asia EOF1 (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_pt}). Positive and negative temperature composites were derived from detrended monthly temperature anomalies from BEST, while precipitation composites were obtained from University of Delaware's monthly precipitation record, as described in greater detail in the Methods section. In general, surface temperature increases are inversely correlated with precipitation, presumably because more energy is stored as latent heat in wetter years. Only a few regions outside of South and East Asia show significant anomalies. Most robustly, the Pamir and Tianshan Mountain region, including Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and the Taklamakan Desert of western China, moisten and become colder in positive All-Asia EOF1 years. This can be seen in the original figure showing All-Asia EOF1 in \citet{Day2015}, and is likely associated with changes in the tropospheric jet shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_u}. Robust warming is found over almost all of India, the Arabian Peninsula and the eastern Sahara in positive years, and also to the north over central Siberia, which is the site of a strong atmospheric ridge visible in Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_z}.
	
	Recent work finds an associated between high-wavenumber Northern Hemisphere summer standing wave patterns and extreme climate events such as Eurasian heat waves that may have been aggravated in recent decades by global warming \citep{Petoukhov2013,Schubert2014a}. The July composite shows strong warming over Russia, cooling over the United Kingdom, northwestern Europe and southern Scandinavia, and rainfall increase over Scandinavia (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_pt}a) . However, the general sparsity of significant anomalies and differences between July and August suggest that the CGT mode itself does not translate to a consistent pattern of temperature and precipitation anomalies across Eurasia.
	
%%% PARAGRAPH ON PREDICTIVITY OF ALL-NEPAL MONSOON RAINFALL - probably not strong enough to be included, unnecessary.	
%	In \citep{Day2015}, we discussed the potential of All-Nepal Monsoon Rainfall (ANMR) as representative of All-Asia EOF1-type variability. Here we show that ANMR has some predictive power on CGT-type patterns. Using a different set of composite years chosen as extreme years of All-Nepal Monsoon Rainfall (Table ~\ref{tab:t42}), we repeat the process in Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_z} for July (several years overlap with peak All-Asia EOF1 years). In August, only a faint CGT pattern is found (not shown), so it may be more reasonable to suggest that the CGT and All-Nepal Monsoon Rainfall are both driven by the same external variability.  

\subsection{Regional Changes Associated with All-Asia EOF1}

\subsubsection{Moisture Transport Across the Yunnan Plateau}

	We examine the regional dynamics within the Asian monsoon that potentially drive All-Asia EOF1-type variability. Furthermore, we can test the hypothesis in \citet{Day2015} that changes in moisture transport across the Yunnan Plateau couple the Himalayan Foothills and Yangtze River Valley and drive All-Asia EOF1. JRA-55 surpasses its predecessors in model resolution and may therefore provide a more credible picture of Asian monsoon dynamics.
	
	%%may also be the case that the model was specifically designed to perform well with Asian monsoon.

	We consider the distribution of diabatic heating within the South and East Asian monsoons associated with All-Asia EOF1. The column-integrated heating $Q$ is calculated according to JRA-55 as the residual of the sum of total column upwelling and downwelling short-wave fluxes $\Delta R_S\uparrow$ and $\Delta R_S\downarrow$, upwelling and downwelling long-wave radiative fluxes $\Delta R_L\uparrow$ and $\Delta R_L\downarrow$, sensible heat flux from the surface  $\Delta SH_{sfc}$ and latent heat flux  $\Delta LH=L \dot P$, all provided as monthly products in JRA-55:
	
\begin{equation}
	Q=R_{S_{top}\downarrow}-R_{S_{sfc}\downarrow}-R_{L_{sfc}\downarrow}-R_{S_{top}\uparrow}+R_{S_{sfc}\uparrow}-R_{L_{top}\uparrow}+R_{L_{sfc}\uparrow}+SH_{sfc}\uparrow+LP
\end{equation}
	
	$L$ is the latent heat of condensation of water vapor and $P$ precipitation. With our composite analysis, we find massive $Q$ fluxes in the Asian monsoon region associated with our pattern ~\ref{fig:cgt_qq}. The radiative equilibrium is dominated by latent heat flux, which is an order of magnitude larger than the other terms (their magnitude generally maximizes at 10 W m$^{-2}$). Significantly, there are no other regions of concentrated Q-fluxes, which suggests that the Asian monsoon region is forcing the CGT in these years.
	
	%WAVE ACTIVITY FLUX COULD HELP PROVE THIS
	
	Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_dyn} focuses on the Asian monsoon region (10$^{\circ}$E-170$^{\circ}$W and 5$^{\circ}$N-50$^{\circ}$N) and only show composite differences that are statistically significant. In both July and August, the Himalayan Foothills and the Yangtze River Valley are a site of diabatic heating, with cooling observed over the Monsoon Zone of India, the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea (Panels a and b). Almost all anomalies in $Q$ are again driven by anomalous latent heat fluxes. The positive heating anomaly corresponds to a coherent belt of surplus water vapor and anomalous ascent stretching from the Himalayan Foothills and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau eastward to the Yangtze River Valley, and onward to South Korea and Japan (Panels c-e). This same belt is also characterized by low- and mid-level westerly wind anomalies and enhanced eastward moisture transport. The general spatial distribution of anomalies closely matches All-Asia EOF1 in \citet{Day2015}. We suggest that changes in the transport of water vapor from the Bay of Bengal supply additional energy as latent heat and drive patterns of diabatic heating.
	
	To substantiate this claim, we separately examine column-integrated moisture transport in each of the positive and negative composites (not shown). In positive composite years, the magnitude of southward water vapor transport northward in southern China reaches 250 kg m$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ versus only about 170 kg m$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ in negative years. In addition, the eastward moisture transport in positive composite years across the Yunnan Plateau is roughly 100 kg m$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, and near-zero in negative composite years (in fact, low-level winds are slightly easterly across the Yunnan Plateau in August per JRA-55). Therefore, JRA-55 suggests that Bay of Bengal moisture is a major summer source of moisture for the East Asian monsoon, and also highly variable. The magnitude of flux from the Bay of Bengal almost certainly does not contribute all of the latent heat flux anomaly, but may instead serve as a convective trigger leading to further diabatic reinforcement \citep{Sampe2010}.
	
	We also look separately at the positive and negative composites for further information on monsoon changes associated with All-Asia EOF1 (Figures ~\ref{fig:cgt_700} and ~\ref{fig:cgt_500}). In positive All-Asia EOF1 years, a tongue of air with high specific humidity stretches eastward from the Yunnan Plateau into the western Pacific (Figure  ~\ref{fig:cgt_700}a). We can also see that low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric ascent are anchored at 30$^{\circ}$N. In negative All-Asia EOF1 years monsoonal flow penetrates much further north, reaching about 35$^{\circ}$N, northern China becomes more convectively favorable between 35$^{\circ}$N and 40$^{\circ}$N and the Yangtze River Valley features only weak ascent. All of the changes described in this paragraph are statistically significant.
	
	Arid northwestern India features very high amplitude according to All-Asia EOF1 although actual rainfall levels are very low. Figure  ~\ref{fig:cgt_500} shows that there is no mean ascent over western India in negative All-Asia EOF1 years, whereas positive years conditions favor ascent. Furthermore, the low-level westerly anomaly leads to significant drying of near-surface air. Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_700} suggests that the, in spite of being next to the Arabian Sea, depends on moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal for its moisture. In strong negative All-Asia EOF1 years the Monsoon Zone of Central India receives, and we
	
	
	

	
	, likely corresponding also to a shift in the Western Pacific subtropical high (cite KOSAKA)
						
			
	Looking at the positive and negative composites of vertical velocity (Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_500}), it is clear that the biggest change is a continuous band of ascent spanning from the Yunnan Plateau across the Yangtze River Valley and to Japan. We can also see major chances in arid western India (Gujarat vicinity), which switches from no ascent to strong mean ascent, possibly explaining the high amplitude of All-Asia EOF1 in that location. In Negative Composite years, Southeast Asia and the southern Bay of Bengal feature considerably more ascent. All of these changes are significant according to Figure ~\ref{fig:cgt_dyn}c.
	
\subsubsection{Meridional Shift of the East Asian Jet}

	Sampe and Xie emphasized the role of temperature advection by the jet, while Jinqiang's paper invoked the standing wave; we bring in a third mechanism, moisture injection through western boundary.

	Over East Asia, Figures ~\ref{fig:cgt_u}a and b reveal that positive All-Asia EOF1 Julys and Augusts are both marked by a \textit{robust southward shift of the jet} between 50$^{\circ}$E-150$^{\circ}$E, with significance of hemispheric change exceeding a 99\% level. We independently examine jet position in the positive and negative composites for each of July and August (Figures  ~\ref{fig:cgt_u}c-f). In the Asian monsoon region, the climatological position of the jet (with core roughly marked by 30 m s$^{-1}$ and 36 m s$^{-1}$ in Figures ~\ref{fig:cgt_u}c-f) is strongly influenced by underlying high topography. We expect high orographic barriers such as the Tibetan Plateau to force deviations in overhead circulation by conservation of potential vorticity, wherein the rotation of the earth encourages atmospheric circulation to move as sets of uniform incompressible columns \citep{Holton2004a}.
	
	The high terrain of the Iranian Plateau upstream from the Tibetan Plateau induces a climatological northward meander in the jet. In positive All-Asia EOF1 years the amplitude of this deviation is small, and the jet returns southward before interacting with the Tibetan Plateau and being forced northward again, with northern apex and maximum velocity over the Taklamakan Desert. The jet then returns southward of 40$^{\circ}$N at the longitude of Eastern China. A strong core beginning around South Korea and Japan persists well into the Northern Pacific, past the International Date Line. In negative All-Asia EOF1 years (Panel e), the northward meander around the Iranian Plateau is particularly large, and accompanied by a strong maximum velocity in the vicinity of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in excess of 40 m s$^{-1}$. The jet returns southward over the Tianshan Mountains, but then recurves northward across northeastern China, North Korea and Vladivostok. At some longitudes such as 70$^{\circ}$E and 130$^{\circ}$E the difference in latitude exceeds 5$^{\circ}$ (over 500 km).
	
	In summary, the CGT corresponds to a meridional jet shift over East Asia. This shift appears zonally uniform, but a closer inspection reveals that the climatological position of the jet is strongly constrained by regional high topography in both positive and negative All-Asia EOF1 years.
	
\subsection{Can the East Asian monsoon force the CGT?}

	The source of CGT-type variability has been debated in the literature. The Himalayan Foothills and Yangtze River Valley are seen to be a region of diabatic heating. Ding's first paper proposed ... (EDIT) However, this does not guarantee that the Indian Monsoon is driving the CGT pattern. \citet{Ding2007} investigated the daily evolution of a Eurasian wavetrain pattern bearing strong resemblance to the CGT. In their estimation, the original forcing lies in the region of the North Atlantic jet exit, a region of very high variability in geopotential height. The downstream propagation of signals from this region then controls active and break spells in the Indian monsoon, equivalent to forcing India EOF1 positively or negatively. The diabatic heating from the Indian monsoon then further strengthens the Central Asian high, which in turn can trigger a Siberian high that brings anomalous rainfall to North China. This mechanism does not preclude the Indian monsoon from also forcing the CGT; perhaps the precursors of Indian monsoon variability may not be visible as propagating waves
		
	NEW ARGUMENT: The phase locking of the CGT in summer is the function of both the pattern of diabatic heating from the distribution of All-Asia EOF1 as well as the TOPOGRAPHY, which sets particular allowed configurations of the jet by conservation of potential vorticity.

	We propose a third potential forcing of the CGT \citet{Ding2007}: Interannual changes in moisture transport from the Himalayan Foothills to the Yangtze River Valley across the Yunnan Plateau. We have shown that this pathway of moisture transport is a key component of All-Asia EOF1 type variability, and also triggers a zonal band of diabatic heating. We suggest that this heating in turn stimulates a CGT-type response by creating a standing trough over central China and ridge over southeastern Siberia in positive All-Asia EOF1 years, and vice-versa in negative years. This can also help to explain the phenomenon of ``phase-locking'' (a preferred phase of the CGT standing wave) observed by \citet{Ding2005}, which is further reinforced by the interaction of the East Asian jet with surface topography seen in Figure ~\ref{cgt_u}. A weakness of \citet{Ding2007} is that they do not have a strong explanation for how North Atlantic forcing can affect the Indian monsoon. Instead, we propose that the heating from the entire Asian monsoon across thousands of kilometers forces the CGT. In particular, \textbf{The particular spatial distribution of All-Asia EOF1, and ultimately the geometry of the Yunnan Plateau, encourage the phase-locking of the Circumglobal Teleconnection in summer (as opposed to winter, when there is no preferred phase).} 

\section{East Asian Jet Shifts and the ``South Flood-North Drought''}

	In the previous section, we showed that positive and negative All-Asia EOF1 years are reflected as zonally-continuous southward and northward shifts of the East Asian Jet extending into the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The relation of East Asian jet latitude and rainfall in July and August leads us to investigate a link between jet position and rainfall in other seasons, using the Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA) Catalog established in Chapter 3. It has been argued in the past that the meridional shift of the jet is simply a local response to heating patterns in the troposphere \citep{Yu and Zhou}. However, the hemispheric mean latitude of the tropospheric jet also reflects the poleward boundary of the Hadley Cell \citep{Kang2015}, and may generally be influenced by modes of global and extratropical variability. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that exterior forcing may alter the position of the jet, and therefore change the pattern of rainfall in East Asia. We do not suggest that the jet exclusively forces the position of rainbands in China, but rather that there may exist a mutual feedback. In the following text, we reveal a close connection of jet and rainfall position in China throughout the Meiyu progression, and also coupled historical change in both (the ``South Flood-North Drought'').

% 4) locally, the jet may take on particular importance to the South Asian and East Asian monsoon
	In East Asian summer, the jet plays an important role both in shaping the climatological distribution of rainfall and in transporting storms. The passage of the tropospheric jet north of the Tibetan Plateau summer is a precondition for the onset of the South Asian monsoon \citep{Yin1949,Yeh1959,Hahn1975}. In East Asia, a positive feedback with the Tibetan Plateau forces high-amplitude standing waves in the jet that in turn create favorable conditions for convection over China \citep{Yang2002,Molnar2010,Chen2015}. Global climate anomalies are thereby translated into unusual local weather\citep{Nigam1989,Broccoli1992,Park1997}. The jet also serves as a waveguide for storms propagating from the Eurasian interior via the ``Silk Road'' teleconnection \citep{Hoskins1993,Ambrizzi1997,Kosaka2012}. The unusually strong meridional temperature gradients in East Asia, which exist because of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, allow for storms to propagate across much longer distances than other regions with weaker temperature gradients \citep{Branstator2002}. It is also well-known from past research that shifts in the jet's latitude and strength change patterns of storminess and rainfall in East Asia \citep{Liang1998,Branstator2002,Kwon2007,Du2009,Li2014}.  Given the interconnections between jet position and climate anomalies in Asia, if global warming has forced a jet shift, this could force changes in the mean or variability of the Asian monsoon.
		 
	 %5) The jet should register changes in monsoon variability between years, and may also INFLUENCE its variability. We pursue this argument to its fullest extent and propose hypotheses for the future of the Asian monsoon. There may be also be local changes in the monsoons that influence the jet. 
	Given the observed interaction between the East Asian jet and Asian monsoon climatology, we expect that anomalies in each time series are also interrelated. We seek to prove two objectives: 1) That the leading mode of July-August rainfall variability, hereafter All-Asia EOF1 \citep{Day2015} also corresponds to shifts in the tropospheric jet; 2) That the South Flood-North Drought also corresponded to \nth{20}-century changes in the East Asian tropospheric jet. By associating jet changes with the leading mode and decadal trend of Asian monsoon rainfall, we may improve skill in the prediction of \nth{21}-century changes in Asian rainfall from anticipating the future of the tropospheric jet.
	
\subsection{Climatology of the East Asian Jet}

	The East Asian jet is closely associated with the five rainfall stages of East Asian monsoon rainfall described in Chapter 3. Beginning in May, the East Asian jet moves from its winter position on the southern flank of the Tibetan Plateau to a summer latitude well north of the plateau.  A full monthly jet climatology is visible in \citet{Schiemann2009}; During this transition, the jet occupies intermediate configurations that correspond to different stages of China rainfall (Figure ~\ref{fig:climo}). Peak rainfall rates in China from May to mid-July corresponds to the months when the climatological latitude of the jet impinges on the Tibetan Plateau, because the interaction of the tropospheric jet and Tibetan Plateau strengthens convergence and rainfall downstream over China and the western Pacific Ocean \citep{Molnar2010,Sampe2010,Chen2014}. From May to September,  the climatological latitude of rainfall, rainbands and jet density are all closely coupled, with peak jet density occurring 5 to 10 degrees north of the latitude of peak rainfall. This agrees with the prediction that, in a region of strong frontal conditions as observed in East Asia, the co-occurrence of a strong upper-tropospheric jet and a coupled equatorward region of ascent and strong rainfall \citep{Holton2004}. 
	
	The initiation of the Pre-Meiyu corresponds roughly to the beginning of the jet's northward passage. During Meiyu season, the preferred latitude of the jet continues to shift northward. The period of frequent double rainband occurrence during the Post-Meiyu corresponds to the jet's maximal northward extent. Finally, the jet returns southward during the Fall Rains in October and November, which produces only a weak rainfall response.
	
	In addition, Figures ~\ref{fig:climo}a-e show mean rainfall, jet frequency and rainband position during each stage, as well as their zonal average (sidebars). From the Pre-Meiyu to Post-Meiyu, each northward jump in peak rainband frequency corresponds to a similar shift in jet count density, with a southward offset of about 5 degrees.
	
\subsection{Jet Changes, 1980-2001 Versus 1958-1979}

	In Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}a, we show the zonal average over $90-130^\circ$E) of mean jet latitude, averaged over the years 1958-1979 (blue solid line) and 1980-2001 (dashed red line) with 95\% confidence intervals overlain. Both significant changes in rainband statistics described in the previous section correspond to southward shifts in mean jet latitude. During the Pre-Meiyu (May), the tropospheric jet is shifted southward by almost 2$^{\circ}$ in 1980-2001 relative to 1958-1979, when its mean latitude was $\approx 41^{\circ}$N. We estimate the significance of this change using a two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Since the K-S test requires that all samples are independent, we first remove temporal autocorrelation due to synoptic variability by assimilating daily mean jet latitude into 4 day blocks. A subsequent K-S test finds that the shift is significant with $p=0.003998$. During the Post-Meiyu (days 201-273), when a southward shift in rainband latitude is found in 1980-2001 relative to 1958-1979, the mean latitude of the jet is also consistently displaced southward. We assimilate daily mean jet latitude into 7-day blocks before performing a K-S test, and find a $p$-value of this shift of $p=0.05667$.
	
\section{Hypothesis}

	The Meiyu front and tropospheric jet covary in latitude from May to September in the climatological mean, and parallel changes are found in rainband attributes and mean jet latitude between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007. Therefore, the South Flood-North Drought appears to reflect an alteration in jet dynamics. We propose that both the Pre-Meiyu decline in rainband frequency and the Post-Meiyu southward shift of rainband latitude result from a single phenomenon: an overall southward displacement of the jet's summer progression over East Asia. In climatology, the Pre-Meiyu corresponds to both a surge in rainfall and the beginning of the jet's northward transit, when its preferred latitude begins to impinge on the Tibetan Plateau. We propose that the observed southward shift in the jet during May has delayed the date when the jet first impinges on the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in a delay in Pre-Meiyu onset and prolonged Spring Rain conditions. This is manifested as weaker rainfall and decreased rainband frequency in central China in May. Subsequently, we argue that the reduced northward extent of the jet during the Post-Meiyu has shifted rainfall and mean rainband latitude southward. Finally, we suggest that the southward displacement of the summer jet cycle results in a decrease in northern China annual rainfall and an increase in central China annual rainfall, producing a South Flood-North Drought response. Thus, our hypothesis can explain the major observed changes in rainfall and rainband statistics during the Pre- and Post-Meiyu as well as cumulative yearly change.
	
	To test our hypothesis, we investigate the relation of interannual anomalies in jet latitude and rainband properties. Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b shows a scatter plot of rainband \textit{frequency} anomalies versus jet latitude anomalies in May (days 121-150). Most years with a decrease in rainband frequency feature a southward jet shift, and vice-versa, and such years occur mostly during 1980-2007. A similar relation is found between monthly anomalies in rainband \textit{latitude} and jet latitude during July-August (days 201-260, Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}c). In the latter figure, we exclude rainbands south of 28$^{\circ}$ N from calculated anomalies, since such rainbands reflect South China Sea storms, rather than jet influence \citep{Day2015}. Together, Figures ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b and ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}c suggest that interannual changes in jet latitude affect Pre-Meiyu rainband frequency and Post-Meiyu rainband latitude.
	
	 %%should probably move away from previous conclusion that jet shifts caused SFND, because causality difficult to distinguish - but, still reasonable to suggest that we can get more predictive skill on the monsoon by understanding future jet changes.
	 	 
	We propose that the delayed passage of the jet to the north of the Tibetan Plateau has shortened the Pre-Meiyu season, decreasing May rainfall in central China, and restricted the northward advance of precipitation, consequently reducing Post-Meiyu rainfall in northern China. This interpretation is a modern analog of the ``Jet Transition Hypothesis'' described in \citet{Chiang2015}, wherein East Asian rainfall changes on paleoclimate timescales are ascribed to modulation in the seasonal cycle of the tropospheric jet. 	
 		 
\section{Leftover fragments}
	%% KEY ARGUMENT
	Causality is difficult to distinguish. The different elements of the Asian monsoon must shift in physically consistent manner, but this does not reveal the initial trigger. The jet changes in the SFND may indeed be simply a local response to patterns of diabatic heating. Nonetheless, we suggest that the historical association between them means that \textit{we can constrain the sample space of future changes in the Asian monsoon by predicting future changes in the jet}.
		 
\section{Conclusion}

	The existence of a Circumglobal Teleconnection in the Northern Hemisphere was only demonstrated and modeled in the past several decades. Its proper resolution depends on having sufficiently powerful global climate models. With the refinement in resolution of JRA-55 we are now resolving All-Asia EOF1 accurately and also showing its association to global climate. In the past, two potential drivers of the CGT were proposed: The Atlantic jet, where variability is highest, and the Indian monsoon, where the anomalies are baroclinic rather than barotropic and diabatic heating occurs. Modeling studies show that heating across the Northern Hemisphere can all force a global wavetrain-type pattern, so we are not forced to choose a singular locus as driver. Nonetheless, we propose here a third driving region - the diabatic heating along the Yangtze River Valley, which produces a diagonally tilted trough-ridge pattern over China and Siberia. In turn, since we propose that the diabatic heating reflects changes in moisture transport, we therefore propose that the topography of the Yunnan Plateau leads to phase-locking of the CGT, not directly by deflecting upper tropospheric circulation, but rather controlling patterns of diabatic heating in the Asian monsoon.
	
	Composite analysis with JRA-55 also suggests that high-resolution reanalysis products feature changes in moisture transport across the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. In particular, positive and negative All-Asia EOF1 years in JRA-55 feature a change in Yangtze River moisture source, from a sizable Bay of Bengal component to being predominantly sourced from the South China Sea. This should also be visible in present-day isotopic records in that region - since the transport distance from the Bay of Bengal to the Yangtze River is long, we would expect water vapor with a Bay of Bengal origin arriving in China to be depleted, and that positive All-Asia EOF1 years should see negative excursions in Yangtze River $\delta ^{18}$O records. This is also a region where many speleothems are located, cave stalagmites featuring tends of thousands of years of continuous deposition from which a continuous time series of $\delta ^{18}$O can be extracted. Traditionally, speleothem $\delta ^{18}$O records are viewed as proxies of local monsoon intensity. However, recent work increasingly argues that East Asian speleothem records such as Hulu and Sanbao are primarily a record of changes in the Indian monsoon upstream that are then transported downwind \citep{Cai2015,Pausata2011,Baker2015}. Proving that changes in water vapor transport from the Bay of Bengal alter the \textit{present-day} isotopic signature in central China would support the new swath of reinterpretation of speleothems.

	We have shown that a significant amount of the annual and decadal variability in Meiyu front activity is accompanied by changes in the westerly jet. Two major changes in the progression of the East Asian summer monsoon were previously reported: 1) A decrease in frequency during the Pre-Meiyu season (days 121-160, May 1-June 9; $p=.0019$); and 2) A southward shift in rainband latitude during the Post-Meiyu season (days 201-273, July 20-Sep 30; $p=.0003$). The latter change is responsible for the South Flood-North Drought trend in total yearly rainfall. In addition, both time periods display a southward anomaly in mean jet latitude during 1980-2007 relative to 1951-1979. We argue that both Pre-Meiyu and Post-Meiyu changes in rainfall and rainband statistics are caused by a southward shift of the summer progression of the East Asian tropospheric jet. In particular, we propose that the delayed passage of the jet to the north of the Tibetan Plateau has shortened the Pre-Meiyu season, decreasing May rainfall in central China, and restricted the northward advance of precipitation, consequently reducing Post-Meiyu rainfall in northern China. This interpretation is a modern analog of the ``Jet Transition Hypothesis'' described in \citet{Chiang2015}, wherein East Asian rainfall changes on paleoclimate timescales are ascribed to modulation in the seasonal cycle of the tropospheric jet. 	
 
	Many components of our results have been presented in previous work. \citet{Xuan2011} find a southward shift in the jet and increased Yangtze Valley rainfall in July. \citet{Yu2004} and \citet{Yu2007} found a southward shift in July-August jet latitude and suggested a link with the South Flood-North Drought. Potential mechanisms for late \nth{20}-century East Asian climate change include changes in Indian Ocean SST \citep{Qu2012}, decreased sensible heating from the Tibetan Plateau \citep{Liu2012a,Hu2015} and aerosol forcing \citep{Song2014}.
	
 By linking the South Flood-North Drought to changes in the seasonal advance of the tropospheric jet, we open the possibility of projecting \nth{21}-century East Asian rainfall change by improving our understanding of the effect of further global warming on the regional and global behavior of the tropospheric jet.
	
	%%VERY LAST PARAGRAPH - ANY INTUITION ON THE FUTURE OF THE SFND?
	
	We suggest a preliminary answer to the question of what will happen to the South Flood-North Drought pattern of rainfall change in China, as well as future changes in All-Asia EOF1.
	
	\citet{Lee2014} analyzed \nth{21}-century changes in a suite of CMIP5 models and concluded that the robust stabilization of the atmosphere in almost all models would tend to decrease the variability associated with the CGT. 
	
		Observations show that the global annual mean latitude of the tropospheric jet has shifted poleward, in tandem with tropospheric heating and lower-stratospheric cooling in the mid-latitudes, increased subtropical static stability, and the expansion of the Hadley circulation \citep{Fu2006,Archer2008,Fu2011}. Opposite trends are found in some regions and the variation by season is significant; we find that the East Asian portion of the jet has shifted equatorward, in agreement with past studies \citep{Yu2007, Archer2008}. Recent work proposes that the observed southward displacement of the jet over the Pacific Ocean was caused by \nth{20}-century changes in tropical Pacific convection and SST \citep{Park2014a}.

Statistical significance at 95\%/99\% level overlain with single/double hatches. Sidebars show, for each time period, the longitude average over 105-123$^{\circ}$E of changes in rainfall (thin blue line, units of mm day$^{-1}$), jet kernel density (red line, units of $10^{-4}$) and rainband position (dashed black line, absolute probability in \%, 1-degree latitude smoothing).}

\caption{a) 7-day running mean latitude of the westerly jet in the region 90-130$^\circ$E for the years 1958-1979 (blue, solid) and 1980-2001 (red, dashed). Bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals are shaded. Time periods: 2 - Pre-Meiyu; 3 - Meiyu; 4 - Post-Meiyu; b) Plot of monthly anomalies in rainband frequency versus monthly anomalies in jet latitude during days 121-150 (May) for 1958-1979 (blue X) versus 1980-2001 (red circle); c) Same as b), but showing 30-day anomalies of rainband latitudes during the Post-Meiyu (201-230 and 231-260, each set of 30 days treated as a separate point). Histograms of anomalies are also shown on the side of each figure.}
