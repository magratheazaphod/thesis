\section{Abstract}
A novel 57-year (1951-2007) daily catalog of frontal rainbands over China is compiled based on APHRODITE rain gauge data, resulting in an unprecedented climatology of Meiyu front progression in summer. Late \nth{20}-century changes in Chinese summer rainfall are investigated (the ``South Flood-North Drought''). Two robust changes in front behavior are observed during 1980-2007 relative to 1951-1979: 1) A significant decrease in the frequency of frontal rainbands during the Pre-Meiyu period (May), and 2) a southward shift in Post-Meiyu rainbands (mid-July to September). In contrast, the years 1994-2007 are marked by an increase in frontal intensity during Meiyu season relative to 1979-1993, but not frequency. By finding changes in the component of China rainfall associated with the large-scale atmosphere, our results begin to address the critical question of whether the South Flood-North Drought will persist under \nth{21}-century global warming.

\section{Introduction}

 	Eastern China receives about 60\% of its rainfall from May to August via the East Asian summer monsoon. The period of peak rainfall lasting from early June to mid-July is called ``Meiyu season'' (lit. ``plum rains,'' referring to the spectacular growth of plum blossoms in central China with the onset of heavy rains). During this time, heavy rainfall occurs in zonal bands resulting from frontal synoptic conditions (the ``Meiyu front''). The rainfall climatology of Japan and Korea also features similar phenomena known as Baiu and Changma respectively. A growing volume of evidence suggests a shift in rainfall over China beginning in the late 1970s, featuring a ``South Flood-North Drought'' pattern shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}a \citep{Hu1997,Gong2002,Nigam2013}. Due to the severe human impacts of the South Flood-North Drought on densely-populated eastern China, it is vital to understand whether this pattern will strengthen under global warming, or represents only a temporary deviation from the mean.
 
	The climatology of the East Asian monsoon bears little resemblance to other monsoon circulations \citep{Ding2005}. Whereas understanding of tropical monsoons has progressed greatly via theoretical studies \citep{Plumb1992,Prive2007,Bordoni2008}, the dynamics that favor the existence of frontal convection over East Asia in summer remain a point of debate, centering around the interplay of the tropospheric jet and Tibetan Plateau \citep{Molnar2010,Sampe2010,Chen2014}. Therefore, no simple conceptual template exists for interpreting a change such as the South Flood-North Drought. However, it is known that the migration of the Meiyu front entails a series of large-scale circulation changes \citep{Chen2004}, and furthermore that anomalies in Meiyu front latitude produce corresponding rainfall anomalies \citep{Kosaka2011}. Therefore, the South Flood-North Drought should be describable in terms of changes in the properties of Meiyu rainbands, such as a shift in latitude, a change in intensity or an earlier or delayed northward migration. In turn, such a characterization may provide insight into the dynamics responsible for the change.
	
	In pursuit of this aim, we have developed a 57-year database (1951-2007) of frontal rainbands in China based on the APHRODITE rain gauge product (described below). We develop a recursive convergent fitting algorithm of daily rainfall maps which finds rainbands and quantifies their attributes. Previous studies have investigated the statistics of the Meiyu front on decadal and even centennial timescales \citep{Chen2004,Ge2008,Xu2009}, but to our knowledge no previous author has compiled a multi-decadal daily catalog of events. We use this catalog to clarify the spatial and temporal attributes of the South Flood-North Drought, and present it as a tool for future East Asian monsoon research. We also expect that the South Flood-North Drought corresponds to larger-scale late-twentieth-century climatic changes, in particular the tropospheric jet, which plays an essential and complex role in East Asian summer climate \citep{Molnar2010}. We propose that changes in the timing of East Asian tropospheric jet migrations induced observed twentieth-century changes in China rainfall. This hypothesis is described below, and will be further explored in future work.

\section{APHRODITE}

Can probably remove subsection since described previously in thesis.

	\textcolor{blue}{The APHRO\_MA\_V1101 product from APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Water Resources) includes 57 years (1951-2007) of daily rainfall (PRECIP product) on a .25$^{\circ}$\ $\times$ .25$^{\circ}$\ grid over 60-150$^{\circ}$ E and 15$^{\circ}$ S-55$^{\circ}$ N \citep{Yatagai2012}. Values are assimilated from weather station observations and therefore available over land only. We focus on the subregion inside of 100$^{\circ}$ E-123$^{\circ}$ E and 20$^{\circ}$ N-40$^{\circ}$ N, where Meiyu rainbands occur. Stations in this region are spaced at 100-200 km intervals (shown by RSTN product), such that rainbands are clearly resolved. APHRODITE's resolution cannot capture some features visible in TRMM satellite data \citet{Xu2009}, but its length allows for the study of decadal change.}
	
\section{Rainband Detection Algorithm}

\subsection{Overview}

	For each day from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007 (20,819 days total), our recursive convergent image processing algorithm determines whether a rainband, defined as a continuous chain of rainfall maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$ spanning at least 5$^{\circ}$ of longitude, exists inside the window of 105-123$^{\circ}$ E and 20-40$^{\circ}$ N. Properties of the rainband are calculated including latitude, intensity, tilt, length and width, as well as a ``quality score'' $Q$, defined as the fraction of daily rainfall occurring within the band. Fits with $Q<.6$ are discarded. We also test for the existence of two rainbands on a single day, an arrangement commonly found in August and September. In such a case, the first and second fitted rainbands are referred to as ``primary'' and ``secondary'' rainbands respectively. Our algorithm does not distinguish between the mechanisms that supply rainfall. Metrics of algorithm performance are listed in Supplementary Tables ~\ref{table:t51}-~\ref{table:t53}. 
	
\subsection{Recursive Convergent Image Processing}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Given a map of daily accumulated rainfall over the longitudes 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N at $.25^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ resolution, the daily rainfall maximum at each longitude is found, and its intensity and latitude recorded. If there exists a $5^{\circ}$ continuous chain of maxima (20 points in a row) exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$, we proceed to step 2 and attempt a fit (Figure ~\ref{fig:f51}a). Otherwise, no fit is attempted for that day (Figure ~\ref{fig:f51}b).
	
	\item In order to approximate the position of the rainband with a best fit line, a weighted least-squares linear fit of the \textit{latitudes} of the maxima is performed in MATLAB using the intensity of each maximum as weight. To encourage convergence, the weight of outlying points is set to zero, where an outlier is defined as any maximum that is over $5^{\circ}$ from the centroid of the precipitation maxima $\left<lat_{max}\right>$, calculated by $\left<lat_{max}\right>=\frac{\sum_{long} lat_{max}*max}{\sum_{long} \max}$.
	
	\item A recursive algorithm converges on a best estimate of rainband position. In each iteration, we find a new set of maxima within \textit{k} degrees of the previous best fit line, and again perform a weighted linear fit of the maxima (Figure ~\ref{fig:f52}a). $k$ is progressively decreased with each iteration from $5^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments, and then from $2^{\circ}$ to $.25^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments but repeating each width $k$ twice in a row (Figures ~\ref{fig:f52}b-c). The fit obtained in the final iteration is taken as our best estimate (Figure ~\ref{fig:f52}d).
	
	\item We define the ``quality score'' $Q$ as the fraction of total daily precipitation inside of  that falls within $2.5^{\circ}$ degrees of the best estimate line (Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}b). Other rainband properties are calculated as follows. Rainband latitude is defined as the latitude of our fitted band at the reference longitude of 115$^{\circ}$E. Intensity is defined as mean rainfall at all points along the band axis where daily rainfall exceeds 5 mm day$^{-1}$ (``rainband points''), length as the total number of rainband points (expressed in units of degrees of longitude), and width as the mean distance between half-maxima on either side of each rainband point (units of degrees of latitude).
	
	\item Given an estimate of primary rainband, we check for a secondary rainband. We start by removing all precipitation associated with the primary rainband from our daily rainfall map. To do this, all rainfall within 4$^{\circ}$ of our primary rainband is set to 0, as well as rainfall at any other adjacent points where rainfall exceeds 10 mm day$^{-1}$ (Figure ~\ref{fig:f53}a). We then reapply the continuous maximum criterion from step 1 (Figure ~\ref{fig:f53}b). If passed, steps 2-4 are repeated to find a best estimate for the position of the secondary rainband, and its attributes calculated.
	
	\item If a secondary rainband is found, two additional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are calculated. $Q_1$ is defined as the fraction of daily rainfall inside of 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N that is contained within $2.5^{\circ}$ degrees of the primary rainband \textit{after removing all rainfall associated with the secondary rainband} (equivalently, the $Q$ score after removing the secondary rainband). Likewise, $Q_2$ is the $Q$ score of the second rainband \textit{after removing all rainfall from the primary rainband} (Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}d).		
	
\end{enumerate} 

In rare cases with two rainbands of roughly equal strength but well-separated in latitude, the removal of outliers in step 2 prevents a fit entirely. We test for such cases by ensuring that the total sum of weights $\sum\limits_{long} max$ exceeds 200 mm day$^{-1}$, equivalent to our condition in bullet point 1. When this condition is failed, which can only occur when too many of our maxima have been discarded, we return to step 1, but find maxima only over the latitude range 20N-$\left<lat_{max}\right>$ or $\left<lat_{max}\right>$-40N, depending on which half of our domain has a longer chain of maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$, and apply the remaining steps of our algorithm as usual.

\subsection{Quality Control}

After running the algorithm for all 20,819 days from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007, we obtained 11,228 days with at least one rainband and 1,116 days with two rainbands. Subsequently, we apply a quality control (QC) algorithm to eliminate days with poor fit, based on the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ as well as the ``Taiwan fraction'' (TW), defined as the percentage of daily rainfall inside the window 105-$123^{\circ}$E and 20-$40^{\circ}$N that falls over the island of Taiwan (roughly 120-$122^{\circ}$E and 22-$26^{\circ}$N. We use these metrics to define the following two criteria for inclusion:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item If $TW > 20\%$, the day's fit is thrown out (238 cases total, 2.1\% of total fits). Such days are dominated by a local storm reaching Taiwan and do not exhibit a strong rainband (Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}a).  
	
	\item Subsequently, a day can be included if it meets either of the following criteria:
	
	\begin{enumerate} 
	
	\item if $Q>.6$, the day is included in our statistics (7,522 days, 67.0\% of total fits; Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}b). If $Q_2$ is also greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double rainband day (Type I double rainband; 232 cases, or 3.1\% of days where $Q>.6$ and $Q_2>.6$).
		
	\item If $Q<.6$, the day is discarded unless two fronts are detected and both $Q_1 \mathrm{\textbf{ and }} Q_2 > .6$ (where again $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are \textit{conditional} quality scores as defined above). In such cases, the presence of multiple rainbands of similar intensity initially obscures the quality of the fit (Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}d). Such days are also classified as double rainband days (Type II double rainband; 466 cases). In the absence of such a double rainband configuration the day is thrown out (Figure ~\ref{fig:f54}c).
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{enumerate}	

	The use of conditional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ adds 466 double rainband days that would otherwise have been categorized as days with no rainband, constituting 6.2\% of total days included in our statistics. 33.2\% of double rainband days are Type I ($Q>.6$) and 66.8\% Type II ($Q<.6$). Double rainbands are more common during certain seasons. Tables ~\ref{table:t51}-~\ref{table:t53} contain more information on algorithm functionality. 

%% BOOTSTRAPPING
\subsection{Significance of Changes - Bootstrapping Algorithms}

	The standard deviation and significance of changes in rainband frequency are calculated analytically. However, the distribution of rainband latitude and intensity during a given season is not constrained to follow a normal distribution (CITATION). Therefore, in the estimation of statistical significance we are required to employ non-parametric tests. In this chapter, estimations of significance were obtained using bootstrapping with and without replacement (the latter also known as a permutation method), well-established techniques that allow the estimation of relevant quantities by constructing synthetic distributions \citep{Good2005}.
	
	Furthermore, rainband statistics are not independent from one day to the next, but rather exhibit temporal autocorrelation greater than 1. Intuitively from our knowledge of weather, the observation of a front at a particular latitude makes it more likely that it will be subsequently observed at the same latitude. We employ a technique known as a \textit{moving blocks bootstrap}, described for instance in \citep{Singh2014}. In this case, data are drawn in sequential blocks of $n$ days depending on the strength of the temporal autocorrelation. The choice of block length $n$ is a subject of substantial debate in the statistical literature, but in practice, the choice of block length ranging from 2 to 5 days does not substantially alter our estimations of statistical significance, although in general the choice of longer blocks tends to return the estimated p-value closer to .5.
	
	In our case, we face the added problem that not all variables are continuous in time. If no front is observed on a day then we cannot report a latitude or intensity. In testing the significance of changes in front latitude and intensity, we have relied on a regular permutation test, because there is no existing convention to our knowledge for handling the case of missing observations in a moving blocks bootstrap. We rely on alternative methods such as the Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to further gauge the magnitude of changes by assessing whether the distribution of the samples has changed between time periods.
	
	We use bootstrapping with replacement to calculate the standard deviation of their means (Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}a and Tables ~\ref{table:t54}-~\ref{table:t58} respectively). Both bootstrapping with replacement and a permutation test produce similar results; $p$-values shown are from permutation testing. Figure ~\ref{fig:changes}a uses a moving blocks bootstrap with block length of 3 days. We focus on changes in front attributes between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 (Tables ~\ref{table:t55} and ~\ref{table:t56}), and also repeat our methodology for 1979-1993 versus 1994-2007, since other authors have found a significant shift between these sets of years.

	Below we attach the relevant code used to perform bootstrapping with replacement, without replacement (permutation test) and the moving blocks bootstrap.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Rainband Climatology}

	The yearly progression of precipitation over eastern China is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:hov}a, longitudinally averaged over $100-123^\circ$E with a 5-day running mean, similar to Figure 7 in \citet{Ding2005}. China receives a substantial fraction of its yearly precipitation outside of summer, unlike other monsoonal regions \citep{Wang2002}. Figure ~\ref{fig:hov}b shows a Hovm\"oller diagram of rainband frequency over all 57 years, including both primary and secondary rainbands. Some periods of heavy rainfall, in particular the August peak over southern China (over 10 mm day$^{-1}$ around 20$^{\circ}$ N), do not correspond to a surge in rainbands. Figure ~\ref{fig:hov}c shows the probability of observing a rainband and mean rainband intensity, and Figure ~\ref{fig:hov}d shows mean rainband tilt and length, as well as the conditional probability of observing a secondary rainband given the presence of a primary rainband. Frontal rainbands over China can appear in any month, with their probability of occurrence and intensity maximizing in late June (80\% probability of occurrence, mean intensity of 31 mm day$^{-1}$) and minimizing in January (10\% probability occurrence, mean intensity of 12 mm day$^{-1}$).
	
	Coordinated, abrupt changes occur in rainfall and frontal climatology. We define 5 periods of notable behavior as demarcated in Figure ~\ref{fig:hov}: 1) The ``Spring Rains'' (days 60-120, March 1-April 30), as previously studied in \citet{Tian1998}; 2) The ``Pre-Meiyu'' (121-160, May 1-June 9), during which rainfall and front intensity increase; 3) Meiyu season (161-200, June 10-July 19) when a remarkable 7-degree northward shift in mean rainband latitude occurs over the course of several weeks, and rainband frequency and intensity peaks; 4) The Post-Meiyu (201-273, July 20-September 30), during which double rainbands are common; and 5) the ``Fall Rains'' (274-320, October 1-November 16), when rainband latitude returns south. The Pre-Meiyu, Meiyu and Post-Meiyu are equivalent to the three stages of Meiyu rainfall described in \citet{Ding2005}. Our results can also  be compared with the event catalog of \citet{Xu2009}, which finds a similar date for the northward transition of the Meiyu front. The total number of rainband counts as well as the mean and standard deviation of rainband frequency, latitude and intensity during each time period are presented in Supplementary Table ~\ref{table:t54}.  In addition, Figures ~\ref{fig:climo}a-e show mean rainfall, jet frequency and rainband position during each stage, as well as their zonal average (sidebars). From the Pre-Meiyu to Post-Meiyu, each northward jump in peak rainband frequency corresponds to a similar shift in jet count density, with a southward offset of about 5 degrees. A yearly asymmetry can also be seen between more frequent and intense rainbands during the jet's northward passage (Pre-Meiyu and Meiyu) versus weaker rainfall during its southward return (Fall Rains), which merits further study.
			
\subsection{Changes in Rainband Attributes, 1980-2007 Versus 1951-1979}
	
	We calculate changes in rainfall and rainband frequency during 1980-2007 relative to 1951-1979, along with their statistical significance (Figure ~\ref{fig:changes}). In addition, we evaluate the significance of changes in rainband attributes between these sets of years during each of the five rainfall stages (Tables ~\ref{table:t55} and ~\ref{table:t56}). Finally, Figures ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}b and ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}c show spatial changes in rainfall and jet count density during the Pre-Meiyu and Post-Meiyu, when changes are particularly large. During the Pre-Meiyu (days 121-160), the probability of observing a primary rainband has declined from $59.0\% \pm 2.0\%$ to $53.0\% \pm 2.1\%$ ($p=0.020$; Table ~\ref{table:t55}). A corresponding decrease in Pre-Meiyu rainfall has occurred in central China (Figure ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}b and 30$^{\circ}$ N in Figure ~\ref{fig:changes}a). The change in Pre-Meiyu rainfall in the late \nth{20} century has previously been reported by \citet{Xin2006} and \citet{Wang2009}.
		
	In addition, a southward shift in mean rainband latitude has occurred during the Post-Meiyu (days 201-273, or July 20-Sep 30). Considering both primary and secondary rainbands north of 27$^{\circ}$ N, which are associated with the jet (Figure ~\ref{fig:climo}d and Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}c), mean latitude during 1951-1979 was $33.6^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .3^\circ$ versus $32.9^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .3^\circ$ during 1980-2007 ($p=.0003$; Table ~\ref{table:t56}). This shift remains significant if we do not restrict by front latitude ($p=.0048$). A Post-Meiyu rainfall increase in central China and decrease in northern China has also occurred, producing a South Flood-North Drought pattern (Figure ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}c). As a result, yearly rainfall has increased in central China even though Pre-Meiyu rainfall changes in that region are negative (Figure ~\ref{fig:changes_2d}a). Unlike \citet{Yu2010}, our catalog does not exhibit a \nth{20}-century decrease in the intensity of Yangtze River region frontal rainbands during July-August. A significant southward shift in rainband latitude is also found for the whole year ($p=.0032$, Table ~\ref{table:t56}), but this signal is dominated by the Post-Meiyu shift.

\subsection{Comparison with alternative metrics}

	It is reasonable to suggest that some simpler metric ought to exist that reproduces the results of the Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA). In this section, we test a suite of daily metrics and use the same bootstrapping algorithms used to calculate the statistical significance of changes in observed yearly rainfall. These metrics are as follows: 1) Latitude of maximum precipitation; 2) centroid latitude of daily precipitation; 3) Intensity of maximum precipitation over China (defined as 100-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N); 4) Mean intensity of China rainfall; 5) Mean intensity of North China rainfall (107.5-125$^{\circ}$E and 37-42$^{\circ}$N); 6) Mean intensity of South China rainfall (107.5-122.5$^{\circ}$E and 27-33$^{\circ}$N); 7) Frequency of North China rainfall and 8) Frequency of South China rainfall. The definitions of the North China and South China regions are taken from \citep{Yu2010}. Their climatology during each of the previously defined time periods (Spring Rains, Pre-Meiyu, Meiyu, Post-Meiyu, Fall Rains and Full Year) is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:type_changes}, and statistical properties shown in Tables ~\ref{table:t59}-~\ref{table:t511}. The significance of changes in each metric between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 is listed in Table ~\ref{table:t512}.
	
	Table ~\ref{table:t512} demonstrates that the metrics produce substantially different aspects of the statistical significance of twentieth-century rainfall changes. A simple area average of North China rainfall reveals the major decline in rainfall in the area at the end of the \nth{20} century, but fails to elucidate the southward shift in rainband latitude visible in Figure ~\ref{fig:changes}a as revealed by use of RDA. Therefore, the increased complexity of RDA is justified by its ability to incorporate several aspects of rainfall change into a single formalism, and its apparently greater sensitivity to changes in attributes.

\subsection{Decadal changes in types of rainfall}

%could add subfigure similar to Figures 5.1-5.4 to illustrate.

	The Rainband Detection Algorithm allows the classification of all rainfall on each day into two categories: banded and local. The classification scheme is identical to the method for removing frontal rainfall when searching for a secondary front as described above. We have created a 57-year data set of rainfall divided into each of the two categories, downloadable from the author's website with the title APHRO\_ZH\_front\_025deg\_V1101.year.nc, where ZH denotes China. The 57-year climatology of each type of rainfall (banded and non-banded) has been compiled into videos that are appended to this thesis, and also available on the author's website (at LINK). A comparison of a pure climatology of China rainfall and its equivalent using only rainfall belonging to bands more coherently shows the seasonal transition between Pre-Meiyu and Meiyu rainfall and the northward progression of mean rainfall during June.

	In addition, we can also test the statistical significance of the changes in both banded and local rainfall. In Figure ~\ref{fig:decadal_front}, we show such changes between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 and calculate statistical significance for full year and the Pre-Meiyu and Post-Meiyu seasons, which contained the largest changes in rainfall. Unsurprisingly, changes in rainband rainfall occur along long continuous bands, while local rainfall changes are considerably patchier in spatial coverage. During the Pre-Meiyu season, we observed a marked decrease in frontal rainfall along the Yangtze River Valley, but also a simultaneous increase in local rainfall in the vicinity of Sichuan Province collocated with the western half of the rainband decrease. In North China, both frontal and local rainfall have decreased during the Post-Meiyu. Taiwan has experienced a substantial decline in local rainfall of several mm day$^{-1}$ with no corresponding change in rainfall from rainbands.

	\textcolor{red}{In summary, the North Flood-South Drought is describable primarily via changes in banded rainfall. In turn, these changes in banded rainfall are mostly zonally symmetric and coherent across thousands of kilometers, which suggests that they are caused by changes in larger-scale dynamics.}

%% ANDERSON-DARLING AND KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TESTING 
\subsection{Significance of Changes in Rainband Latitude and Intensity Distribution}

We can also test for the statistical significance of the change in the entire distribution, using statistical tests such as the Anderson-Darling test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Each of these tests define test statistics that indicate a confidence estimate that two samples are drawn from the same statistical distribution. The Anderson-Darling test places more weight on outliers relative to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but both are accepted metrics of whether two samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution or not. 

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test depends first on the definition of the empirical distribution function, equivalent to a statement that each of the observations $X_i$ are weighted evenly in the construction of a cumulative distribution function (CDF):

\begin{align}
	F_n(x) =& \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I_{[-\infty,x]} (X_i) \\
	I_{[-\infty,x]} =& 
	\begin{cases}
   		 1 & \text{if } X_i \leq x\\
    		0 & \text{otherwise} \\
    	\end{cases}
\end{align}

Given this definition of $F_n(x)$ we compare the cumulative distribution functions of samples $F_1(x)$ and $F_2(x)$ and find their maximal distance $D$:

\begin{equation}
	D=\max_x |F_{1}(x)-F_{2}(x)|
\end{equation}

We can reject the null hypothesis that both samples are drawn from the same distribution if D exceeds a critical value given in the literature. In this case, we rely on its implementation in the R programming language. The Anderson-Darling (A-D) test statistic is similar to its K-S counterpart, but formulated to be more sensitive to the tails of the distribution:

\begin{equation}
	A^2 = -n-S \,,
	\mathrm{where}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	S=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{2i-1}{n}\left[\ln(F(Y_i)) + \ln\left(1-F(Y_{n+1-i})\right)\right].
\end{equation}

The Anderson-Darling test is similarly carried out in R, and a $p$-value returned based on the comparison of the test statistic $A$ to known critical values. The changes in distribution of latitude and intensity are each shown on separate pages below. In general, the results of the Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are in agreement with one another, and confirm earlier results (Tables ~\ref{table:t513} and ~\ref{table:t514}). The Pre-Meiyu decline in rainband frequency after 1979 is not reflected in either test, because it is a change in textit{frequency}. On the other hand, the post-Meiyu southward shift in rainband latitude is found to be highly significant by both tests ($p<.001$). No significant changes in rainband intensity are found between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007. Finally, between the time periods 1979-1993 and 1994-2007, a substantial change is found in both the latitude of rainbands during Meiyu season, as well as their intensity when they occur. These tests help to confirm in a statistically rigorous manner that the changes between the time periods 1951-1979 v 1980-2007 and 1979-1993 v 2004-2007 are of a fundamentally distinct character.

\section{Does the ``South Flood-North Drought'' reflect a jet shift?}

	We also explore decadal changes in the subtropical jet, which plays an essential and complex role in East Asian climate both in summer and winter \citep{Molnar2010,Yang2002}. In a region of strong fronts as observed in East Asia, theory predicts that the core of maximum zonal wind should anchor an equatorward region of ascent and strong rainfall \citep{Holton2004}. The Tibetan Plateau couples with the jet nonlinearly, amplifying the regional response to global climate anomalies \citep{Nigam1989,Broccoli1992,Park1997}. The jet's passage north of the Tibetan Plateau in summer is argued to dictate the timing of onset of the Indian and East Asian monsoons, both in present-day \citep{Yin1949,Yeh1959,Hahn1975} and on paleoclimate timescales \citep{Nagashima2011,Nagashima2013,Chiang2015}. On a weekly timescale, the jet serves as a waveguide for storms propagating from the Eurasian interior via the ``Silk Road'' teleconnection \citep{Hoskins1993,Ambrizzi1997,Kosaka2012}, and shifts in its latitude and strength induce corresponding rainfall anomalies \citep{Liang1998,Kwon2007,Du2009,Li2014}. Thus, we expect that the South Flood-North Drought has also entailed \nth{20}-century changes in the East Asian tropospheric jet. Therefore, we compare our rainband database to a database of jet counts from 1958 to 2001 from \citet{Schiemann2009} in search of coupled change.
	
\subsection{Jet Count Density} 

	\citet{Schiemann2009} constructed a data set of jet `counts' in the Tibetan Plateau region (46$^{\circ}$ E-130$^{\circ}$ E, 17$^{\circ}$ N-58$^{\circ}$ N) from ERA-40 reanalysis for 1958-2001, where a count is defined as any local maximum in zonal wind with westerly magnitude greater than $30$ m s$^{-1}$; further details can be found in section 2 of \citet{Schiemann2009}. We show daily mean jet latitude averaged across $90-130^\circ$E in Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}a and monthly anomalies in Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b. Results are not sensitive to the choice of longitude range. Figure ~\ref{fig:climo} presents contours of jet frequency estimated by a kernel density method, which estimates a probability distribution from a set of discrete data observations (Supplementary Text S4).

\subsection{Dynamics}

	The tropospheric jet marks the northern boundary of the Hadley Cell, and shifts in response to seasonal changes in insolation \citep{Bordoni2008}. Beginning in May, the East Asian jet moves from its winter position on the southern flank of the Tibetan Plateau to a summer latitude well north of the plateau. During this transition, the jet occupies intermediate configurations that correspond to different stages of China rainfall (Figure ~\ref{fig:climo}). A full monthly jet climatology is visible in \citet{Schiemann2009}. Peak rainfall rates in China from May to mid-July corresponds to the months when the climatological latitude of the jet impinges on the Tibetan Plateau. The interaction of the tropospheric jet and Tibetan Plateau strengthens convergence and rainfall downstream over China and the western Pacific Ocean \citep{Molnar2010,Sampe2010,Chen2014}. From May to September,  the climatological latitude of rainfall, rainbands and jet density are all closely coupled, with peak jet density occurring 5 to 10 degrees north of the latitude of peak rainfall. The initiation of the Pre-Meiyu corresponds roughly to the beginning of the jet's northward passage. During Meiyu season, the preferred latitude of the jet continues to shift northward. The period of frequent double rainband occurrence during the Post-Meiyu corresponds to the jet's maximal northward extent. Finally, the jet returns southward during the Fall Rains in October and November, which produces only a weak rainfall response.
	
\subsection{Jet Changes, 1980-2001 Versus 1958-1979}

	In Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}a, we show the zonal average over $90-130^\circ$E) of mean jet latitude, averaged over the years 1958-1979 (blue solid line) and 1980-2001 (dashed red line) with 95\% confidence intervals overlain. Both significant changes in rainband statistics described in the previous section correspond to southward shifts in mean jet latitude. During the Pre-Meiyu (May), the tropospheric jet is shifted southward by almost 2$^{\circ}$ in 1980-2001 relative to 1958-1979, when its mean latitude was $\approx 41^{\circ}$N. We estimate the significance of this change using a two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Since the K-S test requires that all samples are independent, we first remove temporal autocorrelation due to synoptic variability by assimilating daily mean jet latitude into 4 day blocks. A subsequent K-S test finds that the shift is significant with $p=0.003998$. During the Post-Meiyu (days 201-273), when a southward shift in rainband latitude is found in 1980-2001 relative to 1958-1979, the mean latitude of the jet is also consistently displaced southward. We assimilate daily mean jet latitude into 7-day blocks before performing a K-S test, and find a $p$-value of this shift of $p=0.05667$.
	
\section{Hypothesis}

	The Meiyu front and tropospheric jet covary in latitude from May to September in the climatological mean, and parallel changes are found in rainband attributes and mean jet latitude between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007. Therefore, the South Flood-North Drought appears to reflect an alteration in jet dynamics. We propose that both the Pre-Meiyu decline in rainband frequency and the Post-Meiyu southward shift of rainband latitude result from a single phenomenon: an overall southward displacement of the jet's summer progression over East Asia. In climatology, the Pre-Meiyu corresponds to both a surge in rainfall and the beginning of the jet's northward transit, when its preferred latitude begins to impinge on the Tibetan Plateau. We propose that the observed southward shift in the jet during May has delayed the date when the jet first impinges on the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in a delay in Pre-Meiyu onset and prolonged Spring Rain conditions. This is manifested as weaker rainfall and decreased rainband frequency in central China in May. Subsequently, we argue that the reduced northward extent of the jet during the Post-Meiyu has shifted rainfall and mean rainband latitude southward. Finally, we suggest that the southward displacement of the summer jet cycle results in a decrease in northern China annual rainfall and an increase in central China annual rainfall, producing a South Flood-North Drought response. Thus, our hypothesis can explain the major observed changes in rainfall and rainband statistics during the Pre- and Post-Meiyu as well as cumulative yearly change.
	
	To test our hypothesis, we investigate the relation of interannual anomalies in jet latitude and rainband properties. Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b shows a scatter plot of rainband \textit{frequency} anomalies versus jet latitude anomalies in May (days 121-150). Most years with a decrease in rainband frequency feature a southward jet shift, and vice-versa, and such years occur mostly during 1980-2007. A similar relation is found between monthly anomalies in rainband \textit{latitude} and jet latitude during July-August (days 201-260, Figure ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}c). In the latter figure, we exclude rainbands south of 28$^{\circ}$ N from calculated anomalies, since such rainbands reflect South China Sea storms, rather than jet influence \citep{Day2015}. Together, Figures ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}b and ~\ref{fig:jet_seasonal}c suggest that interannual changes in jet latitude affect Pre-Meiyu rainband frequency and Post-Meiyu rainband latitude.

	 Observations show that the global annual mean latitude of the tropospheric jet has shifted poleward, in tandem with tropospheric heating and lower-stratospheric cooling in the mid-latitudes, increased subtropical static stability, and the expansion of the Hadley circulation \citep{Fu2006,Archer2008,Fu2011}. Opposite trends are found in some regions and the variation by season is significant; we find that the East Asian portion of the jet has shifted equatorward, in agreement with past studies \citep{Yu2007, Archer2008}. Recent work proposes that the observed southward displacement of the jet over the Pacific Ocean was caused by \nth{20}-century changes in tropical Pacific convection and SST \citep{Park2014a}. Thus, the global poleward trend in jet latitude and the East Asian equatorward shift are compatible observations that reflect the heterogeneous spatial distribution of \nth{20}-century warming.
	 
	 In addition to the late 1970s change in China rainfall, earlier onset of rainfall over the South China Sea during 1994-2008 relative to 1979-1993 has been reported \citep{Kajikawa2012}, as well as an increase in rainfall over southern China and in the passage of tropical cyclones \citep{Kwon2007,Chang2014}. In Tables ~\ref{table:t57} and ~\ref{table:t58}, we find a rise in rainband intensity during Meiyu season (days 161-200) from 27.3 to 29.8 mm day$^{-1}$ ($p=.9994$), and a southward shift in rainband latitude from 30.0$^{\circ}$ N to 28.9$^{\circ}$\ N ($p=.0002$). No significant changes are found in rainband frequency or jet latitude. The strengthening and southward shift of Meiyu season rainbands beginning in the mid-1990s merits further investigation.
	 				
\section{Conclusion}

	Using a recursive convergent image processing algorithm, we created an unprecedented database and 57-year climatology of frontal rainfall properties over China, including probability of rainband occurrence and mean latitude, intensity, tilt, width and length. Two statistically significant changes in rainband attributes occurred between the years 1951-1979 and 1980-2007: 1) A decrease in frequency during the Pre-Meiyu season (days 121-160, May 1-June 9; $p=.020$); and 2) A southward shift in latitude of rainbands during the Post-Meiyu season (days 201-273, July 20-Sep 30; $p=.0003$). The latter change is responsible for the South Flood-North Drought trend in total yearly rainfall. During 1994-2007 versus 1979-1993, a substantially different change is found featuring a substantial change in both rainband latitude and intensity during Meiyu season, as quantified by an Anderson-Darling test ($p=.0002$ and $p=.0006$ respectively). Our algorithm shows that 55.6\% of total rainfall falling over China from 1951 to 2007 occurs in rainbands. The development of the rainband detection algorithm allows us to study both frontal rainfall, which is associated with larger-scale variability, and local storms, which may result from meso-scale features such as low mountains, and the distinct changes in each. Each type of rainfall is separately available our data set.
	 
	It is essential to understand whether the South Flood-North Drought will persist under \nth{21}-century warming, or manifests an ephemeral decadal change. However, the CMIP5 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project) model suite contained in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) does not agree on the sign of future summer rainfall changes in East Asia \citep{Christensen2011}. In this study, we have found robust changes in frontal rainfall. The poleward expansion of the Hadley Cell is projected to continue under \nth{21}-century warming \citep{Lu2007,Kang2012}, but a recent study predicts that anomalous \nth{21}-century heating of the eastern Pacific Ocean will drive the Pacific jet further equatorward \citep{Park2014}. By linking the South Flood-North Drought to changes in the seasonal advance of the tropospheric jet, we open the possibility of projecting \nth{21}-century East Asian rainfall change by improving our understanding of the effect of further global warming on the regional and global behavior of the tropospheric jet.
	
	Many components of our results have been presented in previous work. \citet{Xuan2011} find a southward shift in the jet and increased Yangtze Valley rainfall in July. \citet{Yu2004} and \citet{Yu2007} found a southward shift in July-August jet latitude and suggested a link with the South Flood-North Drought. Potential mechanisms for late \nth{20}-century East Asian climate change include changes in Indian Ocean SST \citep{Qu2012}, decreased sensible heating from the Tibetan Plateau \citep{Liu2012a,Hu2015} and aerosol forcing \citep{Song2014}. Other studies attribute the South Flood-North Drought to natural variability \citep{Zhang1999,Xin2006,Lei2014}, but \citet{Zhou2009} claimed that the South Flood-North Drought was distinct from other patterns of \nth{20}-century variability.

\caption{a) 7-day running mean latitude of the westerly jet in the region 90-130$^\circ$E for the years 1958-1979 (blue, solid) and 1980-2001 (red, dashed). Bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals are shaded. Time periods: 2 - Pre-Meiyu; 3 - Meiyu; 4 - Post-Meiyu; b) Plot of monthly anomalies in rainband frequency versus monthly anomalies in jet latitude during days 121-150 (May) for 1958-1979 (blue X) versus 1980-2001 (red circle); c) Same as b), but showing 30-day anomalies of rainband latitudes during the Post-Meiyu (201-230 and 231-260, each set of 30 days treated as a separate point). Histograms of anomalies are also shown on the side of each figure.}
