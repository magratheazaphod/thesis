\chapter{A 57-year Catalog of Meiyu Front Variability and the ``South Flood-North Drought''}

\section{Abstract}
Changes in rainfall can be traced to changes either in the frequency of events, or in their mean intensity. However, according to \cite{Biasutti2011}, the instantaneous strength of rainfall does not change with time - therefore, long-term changes can be traced to changes in frequency.
