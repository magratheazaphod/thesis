\chapter{Dynamics of Asian Rainfall Coupling : an LMDZ Modeling Effort}

\section{Abstract}
The prior sections have put forth two hypotheses. First, that moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal to China across the Yunnan Plateau links the variability of the two monsoons. Second of all, that the ``South Flood-North Drought'' is also a reflection of the southward translation of the tropospheric jet's seasonal cycle.

Both of these have been found from a statistical, data analytic perspective. In this section we seek to reproduce their salient features in the LMDZ global climate model (GCM). Finally, we also seek to answer whether these phenomena are further linked, since both invoke substantial changes in Asian climate in July and August.

\section{Observations of linked change}

Most importantly, should show that All-Asia EOF1 also entails massive shifts in the jet.
