abstract = {A distinctive strong tropospheric cooling trend is found in East Asia during July and August. The cooling trend is most prominent at the upper troposphere around 300 hPa. Accompanying this summer cooling the upper-level westerly jet stream over East Asia shifts southward and the East Asian summer monsoon weakens, which results in the tendency toward increased droughts in northern China and flood in Yangtze River Valley. The observational evidences raise the possibility that the East Asian summer tropospheric cooling links to the stratosphere temperature changes and the interaction between the troposphere and stratosphere.},

@article{Schiemann2009,
abstract = {In this study, 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data are used for the description of the seasonal cycle and the interannual variability of the westerly jet in the Tibetan Plateau region. To complement results based on the analysis of monthly mean horizontal wind speeds, an occurrence-based jet climatology is constructed by identifying the locations of the jet axes at 6-hourly intervals throughout 19582001. Thus, a dataset describing the highly transient and localized features of jet variability is obtained. During winter and summer the westerly jet is located, respectively, to the south and north of the Tibetan Plateau. During the spring and autumn seasons there are jet transitions from south to north and vice versa. The median dates for these transitions are 28 April and 12 October. The spring transition is associated with large interannual variations, while the fall transition occurs more reliably within a 3-week period. The strength of the jet exhibits a peculiar seasonal cycle. During northward migration in April/May, the jet intensity weakens and its latitudinal position varies largely. In some springs, there are several transitions and split configurations occur before the jet settles in its northern summer position. In June, a well-defined and unusually strong jet reappears at the northern flanks of the Tibetan Plateau. In autumn, the jet gradually but reliably recedes to the south and is typically more intense than in spring. The jet transitions between the two preferred locations follow the seasonal latitudinal migration of the jet in the Northern Hemisphere. An analysis of interannual variations shows the statistical relationship between the strength of the summer jet, the tropospheric meridional temperature gradient, and the all-India rainfall series. Both this analysis and results from previous studies point to the particular dynamical relevance of the onsetting Indian summer monsoon precipitation and the associated diabatic heating for the formation of the strong summer jet. Finally, an example is provided that illustrates the climatological significance of the jet in terms of the covariation between the jet location and the spatial precipitation distribution in central Asia.},

@article{Annamalai2001,
abstract = {In this study, various diagnostics have been applied to daily observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and ECMWF ReAnalysis (ERA) products to provide a comprehensive description of the active/break cycles associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon and to address the differing behaviour of the two dominant time scales of intraseasonal variability, 10-20 days and 30-60 days. Composite analysis of OLR based on filtered daily All-India rainfall (AIR) for the 40 day (30-60 days) intraseasonal mode indicates that during active phases, convection is significantly enhanced over the Indian continent, extending over the Bay of Bengal, Maritime continent and equatorial west Pacific, while convection is suppressed over the equatorial Indian Ocean and northwest tropical Pacific, resulting in a 'quadrapole' structure over the Asian monsoon domain. In response to this heating pattern, the large-scale Hadley (lateral) and the two cast-west (transverse) tropical circulations are enhanced. There is also a significant impact on the extra-tropical circulation through excitation and propagation of Rossby waves. In contrast, the 15-day mode is more regional to the monsoon domain and has a prominent cast-west orientation in convection. Only the local Hadley circulation over the monsoon region is modulated by this mode. The evolution of these two modes as revealed by POP (principal oscillation pattern) analysis, shows that the 40-day mode originates over the equatorial Indian Ocean. Once formed it has poleward propagation on either side of the equator, and eastward propagation into the equatorial west Pacific. From the equatorial west Pacific, northward propagation over the west Pacific and westward propagation into the Indian longitudes are prominent. The propagative features are complex and interactive and are responsible for the 'quadrapole' structure in convection seen from the composites. The interannual variability, assessed from the POP coefficient time series, indicates that the 40-day mode is strong during the onset phase of the monsoon in all the years but systematic propagation over the entire season depends crucially on the activity of the oceanic TCZ (tropical convergence zone). The POP analysis of the 15-day mode indicates that this event originates over the equatorial west Pacific, associated with westward propagating Rossby waves, amplifies over the northwest tropical Pacific and modulates both the continental and oceanic TCZs over Indian longitudes simultaneously. This mode is pronounced during the established phase of the monsoon. Due to the complexity in the propagational features of both the intraseasonal modes, it is concluded that understanding the subseasonal variability of one regional component of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM), requires understanding the entire ASM system.},

abstract = {The dominant patterns of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and their relationships with the sea surface temperature and 850-hPa wind fields are examined using gridded datasets from 1900 on. The two leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of ISMR over India are used as basis functions for elucidating these relationships. EOF1 is highly correlated with all India rainfall and El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation indices. EOF2 involves rainfall anomalies of opposing polarity over the Gangetic Plain and peninsular India. The spatial pattern of the trends in ISMR from 1950 on shows drying over the Gangetic Plain projects onto EOF2, with an expansion coefficient that exhibits a pronounced trend during this period. EOF2 is coupled with the dominant pattern of sea surface temperature variability over the Indian Ocean sector, which involves in-phase fluctuations over the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the South China Sea, and it is correlated with the previous winter's El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation indices. The circulation anomalies observed in association with fluctuations in the time-varying indices of EOF1 and EOF2 both involve distortions of the low-level monsoon flow. EOF1 in its positive polarity represents a southward deflection of moist, westerly monsoon flow from the Arabian Sea across India, resulting in a smaller flux of moisture to the Himalayas. EOF2 in its positive polarity represents a weakening of the monsoon trough over northeastern India and the westerly monsoon flow across southern India, reminiscent of the circulation anomalies observed during break periods within the monsoon season.},

@article{Trenberth1991,
abstract = {The extent to which mass is conserved in European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses archived on pressure surfaces is examined from two perspectives and with two different datasets. The data used come from the WMO archive of 7-level, twice daily initialized analyses and from the WCRP archive of 14-level, four-times daily uninitialized analyses. The first perspective, which considers the equation of continuity in pressure coordinates locally in three dimensions, reveals spurious residuals in the equation of up to 100\% of the size of the divergence term, with largest errors of 60\% to 100\% in the tropics. In this case the horizontal velocity and vertical p-velodty () fields are checked for consistency. Modest improvements occur when 14 versus 7 levels are used. The second perspective considers the vertical integral in which the surface pressure tendency should balance the total mass convergence into a column, and thus does not involve the omega fields. The latter reveals that the dominant residual is due to the failure to resolve the semidiurnal tide with only twice-daily data, so that a large-scale wavenumber 2 pattern with maxima in the tropics results as a residual. However, there are also many smaller scale and smaller amplitude features in the residual that cannot be explained simply. The residuals from the uninitialized analyses are much larger so that while four-times daily data removes much of the wavenumber 2 semidiurnal tide structure, the total residuals are just as large as with the twice-daily initialized data. Improvements in using 14 levels versus 7 are marginal for the vertical integral. The moisture budget, which is an important part of the overall mass budget, produces plausible estimates of vertically integrated evaporation minus precipitation, but needs to be validated.The primary source of the mass imbalance arises from the methods of postprocessing the variables onto pressure surfaces. Because sophisticated four-dimensional data assimilation now performs analyses of fields on model (sigma) surfaces, the postprocessing performs interpolations (using splines under tension) from model coordinates to pressure coordinates, with the result that the archived variables are really representative of individual levels rather than finite-sized layers. The implications are that residuals computed in other budgets, such as diabatic heating from the thermodynamic equation, will also include large errors, most of which will, however, be systematic.The effects of several common approximations in the treatment of the lower boundary on mass conservation are examined, and proper accounting for the full variations in both space and time of surface pressure on vertical mass integrals lead to the computation of kinematic orographic forcing from the analyses as a residual. The diagnosed lower boundary-induced vertical motions are weak and do not reveal the strong dipole patterns normally expected, which may indicate that the planetary waves are not adequately forced in the forecast model used in the four-dimensional data assimilation.},

abstract = {The Asian summer monsoon affects more than sixty percent of the world's population; understanding its controlling factors is becoming increasingly important due to the expanding human influence on the environment and climate and the need to adapt to global climate change. Various mechanisms have been suggested; however, an overarching paradigm delineating the dominant factors for its generation and strength remains debated. Here we use observation data and numerical experiments to demonstrates that the Asian summer monsoon systems are controlled mainly by thermal forcing whereas large-scale orographically mechanical forcing is not essential: the South Asian monsoon south of 20N by land-sea thermal contrast, its northern part by the thermal forcing of the Iranian Plateau, and the East Asian monsoon and the eastern part of the South Asian monsoon by the thermal forcing of the Tibetan Plateau.},

@article{Boos2013,
abstract = {Elevated heating by the Tibetan Plateau was long thought to drive the South Asian summer monsoon, but recent work showed this monsoon was largely unaffected by removal of the plateau in a climate model, provided the narrow orography of adjacent mountain ranges was preserved. There is debate about whether those mountain ranges generate a strong monsoon by insulating the thermal maximum from cold and dry extratropical air or by providing a source of elevated heating. Here we show that the strength of the monsoon in a climate model is more sensitive to changes in surface heat fluxes from non-elevated parts of India than it is to changes in heat fluxes from adjacent elevated terrain. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that orography creates a strong monsoon by serving as a thermal insulator, and suggests that monsoons respond most strongly to heat sources coincident with the thermal maximum.},

abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA-40, ERA-Interim, University of Washington (UW) data, APHRODITE's Water Resources (APHRODITE), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation estimates are compared with each other and with the corrected gauge observations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at both basin and plateau scales. The ERA-40 generally can capture the broad spatial and temporal distributions in the gauge-based precipitation estimates over the TP. However, the ERA-40 shows little agreement with the gauge-based precipitation in annual variations for the years before 1979. The anticipated improvements in the ERA-Interim precipitation relative to ERA-40 have not been realized in this study. It greatly overestimates the Corrected-China Meteorological Administration (CMA) (by 74â€“290\%) and other datasets, although the ERA-Interim has a better correspondence than ERA-40 with the Corrected-CMA data at both annual and monthly scales among the selected basins. All the products can detect the large-scale precipitation regime, including the monsoon-dominated precipitation in summer and the westerly-wind-induced precipitation in winter. The Corrected-CMA and APHRODITE estimates generally show decreasing trends in summer and increasing trends in spring and winter precipitation during 1961â€“2007 at both basin and plateau scales. However, the Corrected-CMA shows larger values in trends and more cases with significance than the APHRODITE, suggesting the effects of the undercatch corrections on the precipitation trends. The use of precipitation derived from current reanalysis projects is less preferable for hydrology analysis than the TP observational data at basin scales. However, using gauge-based precipitation datasets as hydrologic model forcings should be careful in the river basins where gauge station network is spare, such as in the Yarlung zangbo river basin. Satellite products still hold a great potential for providing high-resolution precipitation information in remote regions such as the western TP, although more evaluations are needed on the feasibility of satellite precipitation products on the TP where the topography is complex and rainfall rate is highly variable.

abstract = {It has been established that East Asian summer monsoon intensity varies with Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, suggesting a connection between the climates of East Asia and the North Atlantic on a millennial timescale. However, the dynamics of such a connection are still unsolved. Here we demonstrate that temporal changes in the provenance of aeolian dust in Japan Sea sediments, which we interpret to reflect changes in the westerly jet path over East Asia, exhibit variations in harmony with Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. The dominance of dust with a Mongolian Gobi provenance during stadials suggests a westerly jet axis located to the south of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau throughout most of the year, whereas the co-dominance of dust from both the Taklimakan Desert and the Mongolian Gobi during interstadials suggests that the westerly jet axis jumped to the north of the Tibetan Plateau at latest in summer. As the shift of the westerly jet axis to the north of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to the onset of the East Asian summer monsoon, changes of the westerly jet path apparently critically affect the teleconnection between the climates of Asia and North Atlantic on a millennial timescale. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {For the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans, internal modes of variability that lead to climatic oscillations have been recognized, but in the Indian Ocean region a similar ocean-atmosphere interaction causing interannual climate variability has not yet been found. Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air-sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12\% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean--and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia--brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

@article{Gleeson2012,
abstract = {Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource that supplies water to billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and influences the health of many ecosystems. Most assessments of global water resources have focused on surface water, but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional and global scales. It remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations, and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref. The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil.},

abstract = {The East Asian monsoon is one of Earth's most significant climatic phenomena, and numerous paleoclimate archives have revealed that it exhibits variations on orbital and suborbital time scales. Quantitative constraints on the climate changes associated with these past variations are limited, yet are needed to constrain sensitivity of the region to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Here, we show central China is a region that experienced a much larger temperature change since the Last Glacial Maximum than typically simulated by climate models. We applied clumped isotope thermometry to carbonates from the central Chinese Loess Plateau to reconstruct temperature and water isotope shifts from the Last Glacial Maximum to present. We find a summertime temperature change of 6-7 Â°C that is reproduced by climate model simulations presented here. Proxy data reveal evidence for a shift to lighter isotopic composition of meteoric waters in glacial times, which is also captured by our model. Analysis of model outputs suggests that glacial cooling over continental China is significantly amplified by the influence of stationary waves, which, in turn, are enhanced by continental ice sheets. These results not only support high regional climate sensitivity in Central China but highlight the fundamental role of planetary-scale atmospheric dynamics in the sensitivity of regional climates to continental glaciation, changing greenhouse gas levels, and insolation.},

@article{Krishnan2000,
abstract = {Abstract In this paper the authors present results of diagnostic analysis of observations and complementary experiments with a simple numerical model that enable them to synthesize the morphology and dynamics of â€œbreaksâ€ in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Almost one week ahead of the onset of a break spell over India, a monotonically decreasing trend in convective activity is found to occur over the Bay of Bengal in response to a steady eastward spreading of dry convectively stable anomalies from the equatorial Indian Ocean. A major intensification of the convectively stable anomalies over the Bay of Bengal is seen about 2â€“3 days prior to commencement of a monsoon break. Both observations and modeling experiments reveal that rapid northwest propagating Rossby waves are triggered in response to such a large strengthening of the convectively stable anomalies. It is shown that an abrupt movement of anomalous Rossby waves from the Bay of Bengal into northwest and central India marks the initiation of a break...},

@article{Liu2012a,
abstract = {Numerical experiments with different idealized land and mountain distributions are carried out to study the formation of the Asian monsoon and related coupling processes. Results demonstrate that when there is only extratropical continent located between 0 and 120Â°E and between 20/30Â°N and the North Pole, a rather weak monsoon rainband appears along the southern border of the continent, coexisting with an intense intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The continuous ITCZ surrounds the whole globe, prohibits the development of near-surface cross-equatorial flow, and collects water vapor from tropical oceans, resulting in very weak monsoon rainfall. When tropical lands are integrated, the ITCZ over the longitude domain where the extratropical continent exists disappears as a consequence of the development of a strong surface cross-equatorial flow from the winter hemisphere to the summer hemisphere. In addition, an intense interaction between the two hemispheres develops, tropical water vapor is transported to the subtropics by the enhanced poleward flow, and a prototype of the Asian monsoon appears. The Tibetan Plateau acts to enhance the coupling between the lower and upper tropospheric circulations and between the subtropical and tropical monsoon circulations, resulting in an intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon and a weakening of the South Asian summer monsoon. Linking the Iranian Plateau to the Tibetan Plateau substantially reduces the precipitation over Africa and increases the precipitation over the Arabian Sea and the northern Indian subcontinent, effectively contributing to the development of the South Asian summer monsoon.},

abstract = {Using hourly station rain-gauge data during 1966\&\#8211;2005, we studied changes in the characteristics of the late-summer (July\&\#8211;August) rainfall, which has exhibited a so called \&\#8220;southern flooding and northern drought\&\#8221; (SFND) pattern over eastern China in recent decades. Although the rainfall amount and frequency have significantly increased (decreased) in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (North China) during this time period, the rainfall intensity has decreased (increased). This finding differs from previous results based on daily data, which showed that the rainfall intensity has increased in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley. In this region, the mean rainfall hours on rainy days have increased because of the prolonged rainfall duration, which has led to an increased daily rainfall amount and to decreased hourly rainfall intensity. Our results also show that the SFND pattern is mostly attributed to changes in precipitation with moderate and low intensity (\&\#8804;10 mm/h), which contributes 65\&\#37; (96\&\#37;) of rainfall amount to the \&\#8220;flooding\&\#8221; (\&\#8220;drought\&\#8221;) in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (North China). Neither frequency nor amount of strong intensity (\&\#62;20 mm/h) rainfall exhibits the SFND pattern.},

@article{Dai1997,
abstract = {The authors have analyzed global station data and created a gridded dataset of monthly precipitation for the period of 1900â€“88. Statistical analyses suggest that discontinuities associated with instrumental errors are large for many high-latitude station records, although they are unlikely to be significant for the majority of the stations. The first leading EOF in global precipitation fields is an ENSO-related pattern, concentrating mostly in the low latitudes. The second leading EOF depicts a linear increasing trend (2.4 mm decadeâˆ’1) in global precipitation fields during the period of 1900â€“88. Consistent with the zonal precipitation trends identified in previous analyses, the EOF trend is seen as a long-term increase mostly in North America, mid- to high-latitude Eurasia, Argentina, and Australia. The spatial patterns of the trend EOF and the rate of increase are generally consistent with those of the precipitation changes in increasing CO2 GCM experiments. The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) accounts for 10\% of Decemberâ€“February precipitation variance over North Atlantic surrounding regions. The mode suggests that during high-NAO-index winters, precipitation is above normal in northern (>50Â°N) Europe, the eastern United States, northern Africa, and the Mediterranean, while below-normal precipitation occurs in southern Europe, eastern Canada, and western Greenland. Wet and dry months of one standard deviation occur at probabilities close to those of a normal distribution in midlatitudes. In the subtropics, the mean interval between two extreme events is longer. The monthly wet and dry events seldom (probability < 5\%) last longer than 2 months. ENSO is the single largest cause of global extreme precipitation events. Consistent with the upward trend in global precipitation, globally, the averaged mean interval between two dry months increased by 28\% from 1900â€“44 to 1945â€“88. The percentage of wet areas over the United States has more than doubled (from 12\% to >24\%) since the 1970s, while the percentage of dry areas has decreased by a similar amount since the 1940s. Severe droughts and floods comparable to the 1988 drought and 1993 flood in the Midwest have occurred 2â€“9 times in each of several other regions of the world during this century.},

abstract = {Late spring (21 Aprilâ€“20 May) precipitation to the south of the Yangtze River in China along the East Asian front is a salient feature of the global climate. The present analysis reveals that during 1958â€“2000 South China (26Â°â€“31Â°N, 110Â°â€“122Â°E) has undergone a significant decrease in late spring precipitation since the late 1970s. The sudden reduction of the precipitation concurs with a notable cooling in the upper troposphere over the central China (30Â°â€“40Â°N, 95Â°â€“125Â°E). The upper-level cooling is associated with an anomalous meridional cell with descending motions in the latitudes 26Â°â€“35Â°N and low-level northerly winds over southeastern China (22Â°â€“30Â°N, 110Â°â€“125Â°E), causing deficient rainfall over South China. The late spring cooling in the upper troposphere over the central China is found to strongly link to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the preceding winter. During winters with a positive NAO index, the upper-tropospheric cooling occurs first to the north of the Tibetan Plateau in earlyâ€“middle spring, then propagates southeastward to central China in late spring. It is suggested that the interdecadal change of the winter NAO is the root cause for the late spring drought over South China in recent decades.},

Yet El Ni\~{n}o events have not always produced severe droughts. We show that El Ni\~{n}o events with the warmest sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific are more effective in focusing drought-producing subsidence over India than events with the warmest SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The physical basis for such different impacts is established using atmospheric general circulation model experiments forced with idealized tropical Pacific warmings. These findings have important implications for Indian monsoon forecasting.},
